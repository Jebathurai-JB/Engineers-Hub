"Soil Mechanics of Earthworks, Foundations and Highway Engineering",,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/01/c8/78/01c87896be8bcaca52e07c089af05f6f.jpg,"
                    This is the third volume of a handbook which covers the whole field of soil mechanics, discussing deterministic and stochastic theories and methods, and showing how they can be used in conjunction with one another. The first volume discusses soil physics, while the second deals with the determination of physical characteristics of the soil.  Australian Mining wrote of the Handbook ``a valuable addition to the extensive literature on the topic and will be found to be more useful than most.''The main objective of the third volume is to present solutions to the problems of engineering practice. It deals with the most important theoretical and practical problems of soil mechanics, discussing the following in detail: stability of earthworks, load-bearing capacity and settlement of shallow foundations, design of pile foundations, soil mechanics in road construction, improving the physical properties of soils, the characteristics of soil dynamics, foundations for machines and soil behaviour as affected by earthquakes. The book not only presents up-to-date deterministic methods, but also discusses solutions of probability theory in the fields of design and safety.The book is divided into six chapters covering the stability of slopes, landslides, load-bearing capacity and settlement of shallow foundations and pile foundations, soil mechanics in road construction, and the improvement of the physical characteristics of soil with special emphasis on machine foundations and earthquakes, giving detailed treatment of each subject. For example, the first chapter deals not only with the stability of slopes, but also discusses the natural and artificial effects, slope protection, filter design, stresses in embankments, and the time factor. In this way, the book gives a clear and comprehensive picture of the special fields of soil mechanics and its subjects. It is therefore emminently suitable for postgraduate engineers, and engineers working in the fields of geotechnics, earthworks, foundations, road construction, engineering geology and statistics, and the design of structures.

                    Residual soils are found in many parts of the world. Like other soils, they are used extensively in construction, being built upon and used as construction materials. Residual soils are formed when the processes of rock weathering proceed at a faster rate than the transport processes by water, gravity and wind, whereby much of the resulting soils will remain in place. The soil typically retains many of the characteristics of the parent rock. In a tropical region, residual soil layers can be very thick, sometimes extending for hundred of meters before reaching unweathered rock.    This book has gathered state-of-the-art knowledge from a number of experienced experts working in foundation engineering in tropical residual soils. Subjects covered are: geology and formation of residual soils, site investigations, characterization and selection of parameters for foundation design, design of shallow and deep foundations which include driven piles, drilled shafts and caissons, and special topics which include design of piles in marginally-stable river banks, micro piles, Augeo pile, pile load and NDT, foundation failures and remedial works, and pile supported embankment. The book also includes a country case study on engineering geology in relation to foundation engineering in Malaysia.

In Thermal Physics: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics are stated precisely as postulates and subsequently connected to historical context and developed mathematically. These laws are applied systematically to topics such as phase equilibria, chemical reactions, external forces, fluid-fluid surfaces and interfaces, and anisotropic crystal-fluid interfaces. Statistical mechanics is presented in the context of information theory to quantify entropy, followed by development of the most important ensembles: microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical. A unified treatment of ideal classical, Fermi, and Bose gases is presented, including Bose condensation, degenerate Fermi gases, and classical gases with internal structure. Additional topics include paramagnetism, adsorption on dilute sites, point defects in crystals, thermal aspects of intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, density matrix formalism, the Ising model, and an introduction to Monte Carlo simulation.  Throughout the book, problems are posed and solved to illustrate specific results and problem-solving techniques.Includes applications of interest to physicists, physical chemists, and materials scientists, as well as materials, chemical, and mechanical engineersSuitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and practicing researchersDevelops content systematically with increasing order of complexitySelf-contained, including nine appendices to handle necessary background and technical details   ",https://1lib.in/dl/2717455/9a083e,610,Elsevier,2015,english,"PDF, 7.57 MB"

                    Written by a world-renowned theoretical physicist, Introduction to Statistical Physics, Second Edition clarifies the properties of matter collectively in terms of the physical laws governing atomic motion. This second edition expands upon the original to include many additional exercises and more pedagogically oriented discussions that fully explain the concepts and applications.    The book first covers the classical ensembles of statistical mechanics and stochastic processes, including Brownian motion, probability theory, and the Fokker–Planck and Langevin equations. To illustrate the use of statistical methods beyond the theory of matter, the author discusses entropy in information theory, Brownian motion in the stock market, and the Monte Carlo method in computer simulations. The next several chapters emphasize the difference between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics—the quantum phase. Applications covered include Fermi statistics and semiconductors and Bose statistics and Bose–Einstein condensation. The book concludes with advanced topics, focusing on the Ginsburg–Landau theory of the order parameter and the special kind of quantum order found in superfluidity and superconductivity.

                    The laws of thermodynamics drive everything that happens in the universe. From the sudden expansion of a cloud of gas to the cooling of hot metal--everything is moved or restrained by four simple laws. Written by Peter Atkins, one of the world's leading authorities on thermodynamics, this powerful and compact introduction explains what these four laws are and how they work, using accessible language and virtually no mathematics. Guiding the reader a step at a time, Atkins begins with Zeroth (so named because the first two laws were well established before scientists realized that a third law, relating to temperature, should precede them--hence the jocular name zeroth), and proceeds through the First, Second, and Third Laws, offering a clear account of concepts such as the availability of work and the conservation of energy. Atkins ranges from the fascinating theory of entropy (revealing how its unstoppable rise constitutes the engine of the universe), through the concept of free energy, and to the brink, and then beyond the brink, of absolute zero.About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.

Soils into which crop plants root and from which they obtain essential minerals and water contain huge arrays of microbes. Many have highly beneficial effects on crop growth and productivity, others are pathogens causing diseases and losses to yield and quality, a few microbes offer protection from these pathogenic forms and others have little or no effect. These intimate and often complex inter-relationships are being explored with increasing success providing exciting opportunities for increasing crop yields and quality in sustainable harmony with the populations of beneficial soil microbes and to the detriment of pathogens. This book explores current knowledge for each of these aspects of soil microbiology and indicates where future progress is most likely to aid in increasing crop productivity by means which are environmentally benign and beneficial.Advanced first degree, post-graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, lecturers, research-leaders, consultants, advisors, crop practitioners and policy makers involved with crop agronomy, biological control, plant pathology, plant breeding, agriculture, soil science, environmental interactions and conservation, and others requiring up to date knowledge of the impact of soil microbiology on sustainable crop production will find this book invaluable.

The world population is projected to reach nine billion by 2050, and in the coming years, global food demand is expected to increase by 50% or more. Higher crop productivity gains in the future will have to be achieved in developing countries through better natural resources management and crop improvement. After nitrogen, phosphorus (P) has more widespread influence on both natural and agricultural ecosystems than any other essential plant element. It has been estimated that 5.7 billion hectares of land worldwide contain insufficient amounts of available P for sustainable crop production, and P deficiency in crop plants is a widespread problem in various parts of the world. However, it has been estimated that worldwide minable P could last less than 40 years. For sustaining future food supplies, it is vital to enhance plant P use efficiency.

The present Volume 4 of the successful monograh package “Multiphase Flow Dynamics”is devoted to selected Chapters of the multiphase fluid dynamics that are important for practical applications but did not find place in the previous volumes. The state of the art of the turbulence modeling in multiphase flows is presented. As introduction, some basics of the single phase boundary layer theory including some important scales and flow oscillation characteristics in pipes and rod bundles are presented. Then the scales characterizing the dispersed flow systems are presented. The description of the turbulence is provided at different level of complexity: simple algebraic models for eddy viscosity, simple algebraic models based on the Boussinesq hypothesis, modification of the boundary layer share due to modification of the bulk turbulence, modification of the boundary layer share due to nucleate boiling. The role of the following forces on the mathematical description of turbulent flows is discussed: the lift force, the lubrication force in the wall boundary layer, and the dispersion force. A pragmatic generalization of the k-eps models for continuous velocity field is proposed containing flows in large volumes and flows in porous structures. A Methods of how to derive source and sinks terms for multiphase k-eps models is presented. A set of 13 single- and two phase benchmarks for verification of k-eps models in system computer codes are provided and reproduced with the IVA computer code as an example of the application of the theory. This methodology is intended to help other engineers and scientists to introduce this technology step-by-step in their own engineering practice.In many practical application gases are solved in liquids under given conditions, released under other conditions and therefore affecting technical processes for good of for bad. Useful information on the solubility of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon dioxide in water under large interval of pressures and temperatures is collected, and appropriate mathematical approximation functions are provided. In addition methods for the computation of the diffusion coefficients are described. With this information solution and dissolution dynamics in multiphase fluid flows can be analyzed.

                    Fuel cell systems have now reached a degree of technological maturity and appear destined to form the cornerstone of future energy technologies. But the rapid advances in fuel cell system development have left current information available only in scattered journals and Internet sites. The even faster race toward fuel cell commercialization further leaves the objectivity of many Internet articles open to question. The Fuel Cell Technology Handbook is now here to help, providing the first comprehensive treatment of both the technical and commercial aspects of high and low temperature fuel cells, fuel cell systems, fuel cell catalysis, and fuel generation. The first part of the book addresses the principles of fuel cell technology and summarizes the main concepts, developments, and remaining technical problems, particularly in fueling. The second part explores applications in automotive, stationary, and portable power generation technologies. It also provides an expert's look at future developments in both the technology and its applications.With chapters contributed by experts working in academic and industrial R&D, this handbook forms a reliable, authoritative basis for understanding fuel cell technology, applications, and commercial realities. Whether you're developing fuel cell components, designing a fuel cell system, or just interested in the viability of an application, the Fuel Cell Technology Handbook is the best place to start.

Principles of Physics: From Quantum Field Theory to Classical Mechanics,Jun Ni,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/e4/b8/27/e4b82754be9c00ce96472a987cfcdcfd.jpg,"
                    This book starts from a set of common basic principles to establish the formalisms in all areas of fundamental physics, including quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, general relativity, electromagnetic field, and classical mechanics. Instead of the traditional pedagogic way, the author arranges the subjects and formalisms in a logical-sequential way, i.e. all the formulas are derived from the formulas before them. The formalisms are also kept self-contained. Most of the required mathematical tools are also given in the appendices.  Although this book covers all the disciplines of fundamental physics, the book is concise and can be treated as an integrated entity. This is consistent with the aphorism that simplicity is beauty, unification is beauty, and thus physics is beauty. The book may be used as an advanced textbook by graduate students. It is also suitable for physicists who wish to have an overview of fundamental physics. Readership: This is an advanced graduate or postgraduate level book.

                    Strength of Materials provides a comprehensive overview of the latest theory of strength of materials. The unified theory presented in this book is developed around three concepts: Hooke's Law, Equilibrium Equations, and Compatibility conditions. The first two of these methods have been fully understood, but clearly are indirect methods with limitations. Through research, the authors have come to understand compatibility conditions, which, until now, had remained in an immature state of development. This method, the Integrated Force Method (IFM) couples equilibrium and compatibility conditions to determine forces directly.   The combination of these methods allows engineering students from a variety of disciplines to comprehend and compare the attributes of each. The concept that IFM strength of materials theory is problem independent, and can be easily generalized for solving difficult problems in linear, nonlinear, and dynamic regimes is focused upon. Discussion of the theory is limited to simple linear analysis problems suitable for an undergraduate course in strength of materials. To support the teaching application of the book there are problems and an instructor's manual.

                    Prepared by the Task Committee on Recent Advances in Canal Automation of the Irrigation Delivery and Drainage Systems Committee of the Irrigation and Drainage Council of the Environmental and Water Resources Institute of ASCE. Canal Automation for Irrigation Systems focuses on the technical aspects of modernizing irrigation systems through use of automated canal control systems. Canal automation has always offered an opportunity to save water and improve the efficiency of irrigation water supply projects or irrigation district operations. Recent technological and engineering advances now enable more accurate control of water deliveries throughout all parts of an irrigation project. Using information collected from irrigation systems around the world in conjunction with new advances in control theory research, this Manual of Practice examines how and when to implement canal automation within the context of canal modernization. Topics include: the modernization process, constraints, and concepts; survey of irrigation physical infrastructure; SCADA systems; control operation concepts; canal hydraulic properties; control methods; verification of controller performance; and implementation of control systems. MOP 131 is an essential reference for professionals in agriculture and irrigation engineering, as well as owners, managers, and operators of irrigation water delivery systems.

A sustainable community energy system is an approach to supplying a local community - ranging from a few homes or farms to entire cities - with its energy requirements from renewable energy or high-efficiency co-generation energy sources. Such systems are frequently based on wind power, solar power, biomass, either singly or in combination. Community energy projects have been growing in numbers in several key regions. This book provides an overview of existing and emerging community energy technologies. Topics covered include data-driven methods for prediction of small to medium wind turbines performance; optimisation of wind farms for communities; financing for community wind and photovoltaic project development; community-level solar thermal systems; solar water desalination for small communities; community solar photovoltaic projects; assessing wind loads for urban photovoltaic installations; design optimisation of multi-energy hubs for community energy projects; battery based storage for communities; power-to-gas and power-to-power for storage and ancillary services in urban areas; smart multi-energy microgrids; and conservation and demand management in community energy systems. Wind and Solar Based Energy Systems for Communities is essential reading for researchers and engineers working to develop community energy systems and advance the transition to a clean energy future.

                    ""Preface In the 1990s, surveying and mapping underwent a transition from disciplineoriented technologies, such as geodesy, surveying, photogrammetry, and cartography, to the methodology-oriented integrated discipline of geoinformatics. This is based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), or GPS, positioning, remote sensing, digital photography for data acquisition, and a geographic information system (GIS) for data manipulation and data output. This book attempts to present the required basic background for remote sensing, digital photogrammetry, and GIS in the new geoinformatics concept in which the different methodologies must be combined. For remote sensing, the basic fundamentals are the properties of electromagnetic radiation and their interaction with matter. This radiation is received by sensors and platforms in an analogue or digital form, and is subject to image processing. In photogrammetry, the stereo concept is used for the location of information in 3D. With the advent of high-resolution satellite systems in stereo, the theory of analytical photogrammetry restituting 2D image information into 3D is of increasing importance, merging the remote sensing approach with that of photogrammetry. The result of the restitution is a direct input into geographic information systems in vector or raster form. The fundamentals of these are described in detail, with an emphasis on global, regional, and local applications. In the context of data integration, a short introduction to the GPS satellite positioning system is provided. This book will appeal to a wide range of readers from advanced undergraduates to all professionals in the growing field of geoinformation""-- Read more...

                    This is not a lite reading book.  It is however and excellent reference book one that I highly recommend for anyone's library interested in GIS, remote sensing and their applications - It covers the use of these relatively new tools within various scientific discliplnes, very useful and still up to date formulas, tables and charts and references for further investigation.  Very technical and very applicable.  Not recommended for everyone.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/736274/c5f5ba,275,CRC Press,2002,english,"PDF, 12.02 MB"

                    2nd ed. — Packt Publishing, 2015. — 394 p. — ISBN: 9781783552429Geospatial Analysis is used in almost every field you can think of from medicine, to defense, to farming. This book will guide you gently into this exciting and complex field. It walks you through the building blocks of geospatial analysis and how to apply them to influence decision making using the latest Python software.Learning Geospatial Analysis with Python, 2nd Edition uses the expressive and powerful Python 3 programming language to guide you through geographic information systems, remote sensing, topography, and more, while providing a framework for you to approach geospatial analysis effectively, but on your own terms. We start by giving you a little background on the field, and a survey of the techniques and technology used. We then split the field into its component specialty areas: GIS, remote sensing, elevation data, advanced modeling, and real-time data.This book will teach you everything you need to know about, Geospatial Analysis from using a particular software package or API to using generic algorithms that can be applied. This book focuses on pure Python whenever possible to minimize compiling platform-dependent binaries, so that you don't become bogged down in just getting ready to do analysis. This book will round out your technical library through handy recipes that will give you a good understanding of a field that supplements many a modern day human endeavors.

                    Surveying and mapping has recently undergone a transition: from discipline-oriented technologies, such as geodesy, surveying, photogrammetry and cartography, to the methodology-oriented integrated discipline of geoinformatics based on GPS positioning, remote sensing, digital photography and GIS for data manipulation and data output. This book presents the required basic background for remote sensing, digital photogrammetry and GIS in the new geoinformatics concept in which the different methodologies must be combined.For remote sensing, the basic fundamentals are the properties of electromagnetic radiation and their interaction with matter. This radiation is received by sensors and platforms in analogue or digital form, and is subject to image processing. In photogrammetry, the stereo-concept is used for the location of information in 3D. With the advent of high-resolution satellite systems in stereo, the theory of analytical photogrammetry restituting 2-D image information into 3D is of increasing importance, merging the remote sensing approach with that of photogrammetry. The result of the restitution is a direct input into geographical information systems in vector or in raster form. The fundamentals of these are described in detail, with an emphasis on global, regional and local applications. For data integration, a short introduction into the GPS Satellite positioning system is added. This textbook will appeal to a wide range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to all professionals in the growing field of geoinformation.
