                    There is no field of enterprise today more dynamic or more challenging than Digital Integrated Circuits. But because of its rapid development, the field has quickly outgrown most of the standard textbooks. The field is also decidedly interdisciplinary. Engineers now must understand materials, physics, devices, processing electromagnetics, computer tools, and economics along with circuits and design rules, but few if any texts take the interdisciplinary approach that best prepares students for their future studies and practice.Author John Ayers designed Digital Integrated Circuits: Analysis and Design to meet three primary objectives:·Take an interdisciplinary approach that will stay relevant for years to come·Provide broad coverage of the field relevant to students interested in designing integrated circuits and to those aiming towards designing with integrated circuits·Focus on the underlying principles rather than the details of current technologies that will soon be obsoleteRich with pedagogical features and supplementary materials, this book appears destined to set a new standard for digital integrated circuits texts. It provides all of the materials you need to offer the best possible course for engineering or computer science students, and it's clear, systematic presentation and wealth of solved examples build the solid, practical foundation today's students need.Prerequisites: Students will need an upper-level undergraduate engineering and science background with courses in circuits, electronics, and digital logic.

This book, Electronic Devices and Circuit Application, is the first of four books of a larger work, Fundamentals of Electronics. It is comprised of four chapters describing the basic operation of each of the four fundamental building blocks of modern electronics: operational amplifiers, semiconductor diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and field effect transistors. Attention is focused on the reader obtaining a clear understanding of each of the devices when it is operated in equilibrium. Ideas fundamental to the study of electronic circuits are also developed in the book at a basic level to lessen the possibility of misunderstandings at a higher level. The difference between linear and non-linear operation is explored through the use of a variety of circuit examples including amplifiers constructed with operational amplifiers as the fundamental component and elementary digital logic gates constructed with various transistor types. Fundamentals of Electronics has been designed primarily for use in an upper division course in electronics for electrical engineering students. Typically such a course spans a full academic years consisting of two semesters or three quarters. As such, Electronic Devices and Circuit Applications, and the following two books, Amplifiers: Analysis and Design and Active Filters and Amplifier Frequency Response, form an appropriate body of material for such a course. Secondary applications include the use in a one-semester electronics course for engineers or as a reference for practicing engineers.

This book, Electronic Devices and Circuit Application, is the first of four books of a larger work, Fundamentals of Electronics. It is comprised of four chapters describing the basic operation of each of the four fundamental building blocks of modern electronics: operational amplifiers, semiconductor diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and field effect transistors. Attention is focused on the reader obtaining a clear understanding of each of the devices when it is operated in equilibrium. Ideas fundamental to the study of electronic circuits are also developed in the book at a basic level to lessen the possibility of misunderstandings at a higher level. The difference between linear and non-linear operation is explored through the use of a variety of circuit examples including amplifiers constructed with operational amplifiers as the fundamental component and elementary digital logic gates constructed with various transistor types. Fundamentals of Electronics has been designed primarily for use in an upper division course in electronics for electrical engineering students. Typically such a course spans a full academic years consisting of two semesters or three quarters. As such, Electronic Devices and Circuit Applications, and the following two books, Amplifiers: Analysis and Design and Active Filters and Amplifier Frequency Response, form an appropriate body of material for such a course. Secondary applications include the use in a one-semester electronics course for engineers or as a reference for practicing engineers.

It will introduce a new way of looking not only at the treatment of circuits, but also at the treatment of introductory coursework in engineering in general.
Using the concept of ""abstraction,"" the book attempts to form a bridge between the world of physics and the world of large computer systems. In particular, it attempts to unify electrical engineering and computer science as the art of creating and exploiting successive abstractions to manage the complexity of building useful electrical systems. Computer systems are simply one type of electrical systems.

FPGA-based Implementation of Signal Processing Systems,Roger Woods,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/f0/d4/73/f0d473cab24cc87c18beb9dbf30ca805.jpg,"
                    Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an increasingly popular technology for implementing digital signal processing (DSP) systems. By allowing designers to create circuit architectures developed for the specific applications, high levels of performance can be achieved for many DSP applications providing considerable improvements over conventional microprocessor and dedicated DSP processor solutions. The book addresses the key issue in this process specifically, the methods and tools needed for the design, optimization and implementation of DSP systems in programmable FPGA hardware. It presents a review of the leading-edge techniques in this field, analyzing advanced DSP-based design flows for both signal flow graph- (SFG-) based and dataflow-based implementation, system on chip (SoC) aspects, and future trends and challenges for FPGAs. The automation of the techniques for component architectural synthesis, computational models, and the reduction of energy consumption to help improve FPGA performance, are given in detail.        Written from a system level design perspective and with a DSP focus, the authors present many practical application examples of complex DSP implementation, involving:       high-performance computing e.g. matrix operations such as matrix multiplication;      high-speed filtering including finite impulse response (FIR) filters and wave digital filters (WDFs);      adaptive filtering e.g. recursive least squares (RLS) filtering;      transforms such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT).            FPGA-based Implementation of Signal Processing Systems  is an important reference for practising engineers and researchers working on the design and development of DSP systems for radio, telecommunication, information, audio-visual and security applications. Senior level electrical and computer engineering graduates taking courses in signal processing or digital signal processing shall also find this volume of interest.

In particular, it attempts to unify electrical engineering and computer science as the art of creating and exploiting successive abstractions to manage the complexity of building useful electrical systems. Computer systems are simply one type of electrical systems.

                    The purpose of this book is to describe the theory of Digital Power Electronics and its applications. The authors apply digital control theory to power electronics in a manner thoroughly different from the traditional, analog control scheme. In order to apply digital control theory to power electronics, the authors define a number of new parameters, including the energy factor, pumping energy, stored energy, time constant, and damping time constant.  These parameters differ from traditional parameters such as the power factor, power transfer efficiency, ripple factor, and total harmonic distortion.  These new parameters result in the definition of new mathematical modeling:  . A zero-order-hold (ZOH) is used to simulate all AC/DC rectifiers. . A first-order-hold (FOH) is used to simulate all DC/AC inverters. . A second-order-hold (SOH) is used to simulate all DC/DC converters. .

                    This book explores the implementation of MATLAB(R) and Simulink(R) in the development of embedded robust control systems. Robust control theory allows for changes in a system whilst maintaining stability and performance. Applications of this technique are very important for dependable embedded systems, making technologies such as drones and other autonomous systems with sophisticated embedded controllers and systems relatively common-place.Three extended case studies are developed in depth: embedded control of a tank physical model; robust control of a miniature helicopter; and robust control of two-wheeled robots. These are taken from the area of motion control but the book may be also used by designers in other areas.Some knowledge of linear control theory is assumed and experience of C programming is desirable but to make the book accessible to engineers new to the field and to students, the authors avoid complicated mathematical proofs and overwhelming computer architecture technical details.

One Thousand Exercises In Probability [Solution Manual of Probability and Random Processes],Geoffrey Grimmett,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/12/84/f3/1284f3024bd50103f8d1de02a7f71208.jpg,"
This book contains more than 1000 exercises in probability and random processes, together with their solutions. Apart from being a volume of worked exercises in its own right, it is also a solutions manual for exercises and problems appearing in our textbook Probability and Random Processes (3rd edn), Oxford University Press, 2001, henceforth referred to as PRP. These exercises are not merely for drill, but complement and illustrate the text of PRP, or are entertaining, or both. The current volume extends our earlier book Probability and Random Processes: Problems and Solutions, and includes in addition around 400 new problems. Since many exercises have multiple parts, the total number of interrogatives exceeds 3000.Despite being intended in part as a companion to PRP, the present volume is as self-contained as reasonably possible. Where knowledge of a substantial chunk of bookwork is unavoidable, the reader is provided with a reference to the relevant passage in PRP. Expressions such as `clearly' appear frequently in the solutions. Although we do not use such terms in their Laplacian sense to mean `with difficulty', to call something `clear' is not to imply that explicit verification is necessarily free of tedium.The table of contents reproduces that of PRP; the section numbers for the exercises correspond to those of PRP, and all questions are numbered as they appear in the third edition of PRP. The covered range of topics is broad, beginning with the elementary theory of probability and random variables, and continuing, via chapters on Markov chains and convergence, to extensive sections devoted to stationarity and ergodic theory, renewals, queues, martingales, and diffusions, including an introduction to the pricing of options. Generally speaking, exercises are questions which test knowledge of particular pieces of theory, while problems are less specific in their requirements. There are questions of all standards, the great majority being elementary or of intermediate difficulty. We ourselves have found some of the later ones to be rather tricky, but have refrained from magnifying any difficulty by adding asterisks or equivalent devices. If you are using this book for self-study, our advice would be not to attempt more than a respectable fraction of these at a first read.

                    The third edition of this text gives a rigorous introduction to probability theory and the discussion of the most important random processes in some depth. It includes various topics which are suitable for undergraduate courses, but are not routinely taught. It is suitable to the beginner, and should provide a taste and encouragement for more advanced work.There are four main aims: 1) to provide a thorough but straightforward account of basic probability, giving the reader a natural feel for the subject unburdened by oppressive technicalities, 2) to discuss important random processes in depth with many examples. 3) to cover a range of important but less routine topics, 4) to impart to the beginner the flavour of more advanced work. The books begins with basic ideas common to many undergraduate courses in mathematics, statistics and the sciences; in concludes with topics usually found at graduate level.

                    Probability and Statistics are as much about intuition and problem solving as they are about theorem proving. Because of this, students can find it very difficult to make a successful transition from lectures to examinations to practice, since the problems involved can vary so much in nature. Since the subject is critical in many modern applications such as mathematical finance, quantitative management, telecommunications, signal processing, bioinformatics, as well as traditional ones such as insurance, social science and engineering, the authors have rectified deficiencies in traditional lecture-based methods by collecting together a wealth of exercises with complete solutions, adapted to needs and skills of students.

Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes is a comprehensive textbook on probability theory for engineers that provides a more rigorous mathematical framework than is usually encountered in undergraduate courses. It is intended for first-year graduate students who have some familiarity with probability and random variables, though not necessarily of random processes and systems that operate on random signals. It is also appropriate for advanced undergraduate students who have a strong mathematical background.The book has the following features:Several appendices include related material on integration, important inequalities and identities, frequency-domain transforms, and linear algebra. These topics have been included so that the book is relatively self-contained. One appendix contains an extensive summary of 33 random variables and their properties such as moments, characteristic functions, and entropy.Unlike most books on probability, numerous figures have been included to clarify and expand upon important points. Over 600 illustrations and MATLAB plots have been designed to reinforce the material and illustrate the various characterizations and properties of random quantities.Sufficient statistics are covered in detail, as is their connection to parameter estimation techniques. These include classical Bayesian estimation and several optimality criteria: mean-square error, mean-absolute error, maximum likelihood, method of moments, and least squares.The last four chapters provide an introduction to several topics usually studied in subsequent engineering courses: communication systems and information theory; optimal filtering (Wiener and Kalman); adaptive filtering (FIR and IIR); and antenna beamforming, channel equalization, and direction finding. This material is available electronically at the companion website.Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes is the only textbook on probability for engineers that includes relevant background material, provides extensive summaries of key results, and extends various statistical techniques to a range of applications in signal processing.

                    This book shows how to model selected communication scenarios using game theory. The book helps researchers specifically dealing with scenarios motivated by the increasing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G Communications by using game theory to approach the study of such challenging scenarios. The author explains how game theory acts as a mathematical tool that models decision making in terms of strategies and mechanisms that can result in optimal payoffs for a number of interacting entities, offering often antagonistic behaviors. The book explores new technologies in terms of design, development and management from a theoretical perspective, using game theory to analyze strategic situations and demonstrate profitable behaviors of the cooperative entities. The book identifies and explores several significant applications/uses/situations that arise from the vast deployment of the IoT. The presentation of the technological scenarios is followed in each of the first four chapters by a step-by-step theoretical model often followed by equilibrium proof, and numerical simulation results, that are explained in a tutorial-like manner. The four chapters tackle challenging IoT and 5G related issues, including: new security threats that IoT brings, e.g. botnets, ad hoc vehicular networks and the need for trust in vehicular communications, content repetition by offloading traffic onto mobile users, as well as issues due to new wearable devices that enable data collection to become more intrusive.

                    The subject of adaptive filters constitutes an important part of statistical signal processing. Whenever there is a requirement to process signals that result from operation in an
environment of unknown statistics or one that is inherently nonstationary, the use of
an adaptive filter offers a highly attractive solution to the problem as it provides a significant improvement in performance over the use of a fixed filter designed by conventional methods. Furthermore, the use of adaptive filters provides new signal-processing
capabilities that would not be possible otherwise. We thus find that adaptive filters have
been successfully applied in such diverse fields as communications, control, radar, sonar,
seismology, and biomedical engineering, among others.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/5206571/03d05c,907,Pearson,2014,english,"PDF, 20.52 MB"

The story of two brilliant nineteenth-century scientists who discovered the electromagnetic field, laying the groundwork for the amazing technological and theoretical breakthroughs of the twentieth centuryTwo of the boldest and most creative scientists of all time were Michael Faraday (1791-1867) and James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879). This is the story of how these two men - separated in age by forty years - discovered the existence of the electromagnetic field and devised a radically new theory which overturned the strictly mechanical view of the world that had prevailed since Newton's time.The authors, veteran science writers with special expertise in physics and engineering, have created a lively narrative that interweaves rich biographical detail from each man's life with clear explanations of their scientific accomplishments. Faraday was an autodidact, who overcame class prejudice and a lack of mathematical training to become renowned for his acute powers of experimental observation, technological skills, and prodigious scientific imagination. James Clerk Maxwell was highly regarded as one of the most brilliant mathematical physicists of the age. He made an enormous number of advances in his own right. But when he translated Faraday's ideas into mathematical language, thus creating field theory, this unified framework of electricity, magnetism and light became the basis for much of later, 20th-century physics.Faraday's and Maxwell's collaborative efforts gave rise to many of the technological innovations we take for granted today - from electric power generation to television, and much more. Told with panache, warmth, and clarity, this captivating story of their greatest work - in which each played an equal part - and their inspiring lives will bring new appreciation to these giants of science.

Electromagnetic Field Interaction with Transmission Lines : From Classical Theory to HF Radiation Effects (Advances in Electrical Engineering and Electromagnetics) ,F. Rachidi,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/44/ad/34/44ad343cb536585fc616eaafcc7de5e5.jpg,"
                    The evaluation of electromagnetic field coupling to transmission lines is animportant problem in electromagnetic compatibility. The use of the transmission line (TL) approximation theory has permitted the solution of a large range of problems (e. g. lightning and EMP interaction with power lines). However, the continual increase in operating frequency of products and higher-frequency sources of disturbances (such as UWB systems) makes TL basic assumptions no longer acceptable for a certain number of applications. In the last decade or so, the generalization of classical TL theory to take into account high frequency effects has emerged as an important topic of study in electromagnetic compatibility. This effort resulted in the elaboration ofthe so-called ""generalized"" or ""full-wave"" TL theory, which incorporates high frequency radiation effects, while keeping the relative simplicity of TL equations.This book is organized in two main parts. Part I presents consolidatedknowledge of classical transmission line theory and differentfield-to-transmission line coupling models. Part II presents differentapproaches developed to generalize TL Theory.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/1227911/4e9c89,280,WIT Press / Computational Mechanics,2008,english,"PDF, 3.96 MB"

                    How does Instagram shape how we relate to each other online? Are users concerned about privacy when documenting their lives in fine detail? How does Instagram work as a marketing machine? Drawing on three years' research with Instagram users, Elisa Serafinelli explores how Instagram is changing people's visual experiences.

Instagram is now by far the most popular online photo sharing platform, fuelled by the growth of smart mobile devices, and the management of an online persona is now part of millions of people's everyday reality. This has not gone unnoticed among commercial actors, with the savviest of these exploiting the social dynamics of sharing that underlie the very logic of Instagram.

This book addresses the issue of how mobile media and visual communication permeate people's daily routines, how marketing influences practice, whether privacy and surveillance concerns are a reality, and how the platform shapes social relationships and identity formation. In its conclusion, the book advances the innovative concept of new mobile visualities to describe the social communication of photography and its huge expansion.

                    Winner of the 2019 Textbook & Academic Authors Association's The Most Promising New Textbook AwardHow can public relations play a more active role in the betterment of society?Introduction to Strategic Public Relations: Digital, Global, and Socially Responsible Communicationprepares you for success in today's fast-changing PR environment. Recognizing that developments in technology, business, and culture require a fresh approach, Janis T. Page and Lawrence Parnell have written a practical introductory text that aligns these shifts with the body of knowledge from which the discipline of public relations was built. Because the practice of public relations is rooted in credibility, the authors believe that you must become ethical and socially responsible communicators more concerned with building trust and respect with diverse communities than with creating throwaway content. The authors balance this approach with a focus on communication theory, history, process, and practice and on understanding how these apply to strategic public relations planning, as well as on learning how to create a believable and persuasive message.Key FeaturesChapter-opening Scenarioscapture your attention by discussing current PR challenges--such as the Wells Fargo cross-selling, VW emissions cover-up, and P&G's ""Like a Girl"" campaign--and thus frame the chapter content and encourage active reading. At the end of the chapter, you explore various aspects of socially responsible communication to ""solve"" the PR challenge.Socially Responsible Case Studiesin each chapter illustrate the key responsibilities of a modern public relations professional such as media relations, crisis communications, employee communications, applied communications research, and corporate and government-specific communications. Each case featuresproblem-solving questionsto encourage critical thinking.Social Responsibility in Actionboxes feature short, specific social responsibility cases--such as Universals' #NoFoodWasted, Nespresso in South Sudan, and Merck's collaboration with AIDS activists--to highlight best practices and effective tactics, showing the link between sound public relations strategy and meaningful social responsibility programs.Insightboxes spark classroom discussion on particularly important or unique topics in each chapter.Personality Profileboxes will inspire you with stories from PR veterans and rising stars such as the U.S. CEO of Burson-Marstellor, the Chief Communication Officer of the United Nations Foundation, and the Executive VP at HavasPR.

Discrete-time Signal Processing: An Algebraic Approach,Darrell Williamson PhD (auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/38/75/b8/3875b8e873c774b79018213c7cafc153.jpg,"
The topics of control engineering and signal processing continue to flourish and develop. In common with general scientific investigation, new ideas, concepts and interpretations emerge quite spontaneously and these are then discussed, used, discarded or subsumed into the prevailing subject paradigm. Sometimes these innovative concepts coalesce into a new sub-discipline within the broad subject tapestry ofcontrol and signal processing. This preliminary battle between old and new usually takes place at conferences, through the internet and in the journals of the discipline. After a little more maturity has been acquired by the new concepts then archival publication as a scientific or engineering monograph may occur. The applications ofsignal processing techniques have grown and grown. They now cover the wide range from the statistical properties of signals and data through to the hardware problems of communications in all its diverse aspects. Supporting this range ofapplications is a body of theory, analysis and techniques which is equally broad. Darrell Williamson has faced the difficult task of organising this material by adopting an algebraic approach. This uses general mathematical and systems ideas and results to form a firm foundation for the discrete signal processing paradigm. Although this may require some extra concentration and involvement by the student or researcher, the rewards are a clarity of presentation and deeper insight into the power of individual results. An additional benefit is that the algebraic language used is the natural language of computing tools like MATLAB and its simulation facility, SIMULINK.

Joint Source-Channel Coding of Discrete-Time Signals with Continuous Amplitudes (Communications and Signal Processing),Norbert Goertz,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/11/17/b6/1117b6c8cffb70ad212a0d16df75d2c0.jpg,"
                    This book provides the first comprehensive and easy-to-read discussion of joint source-channel encoding and decoding for source signals with continuous amplitudes. It is a state-of-the-art presentation of this exciting, thriving field of research, making pioneering contributions to the new concept of source-adaptive modulation. The book starts with the basic theory and the motivation for a joint realization of source and channel coding. Specialized chapters deal with practically relevant scenarios such as iterative source-channel decoding and its optimization for a given encoder, and also improved encoder designs by channel-adaptive quantization or source-adaptive modulation.Although Information Theory is not the main topic of the book - in fact, the concept of joint source-channel coding is contradictory to the classical system design motivated by a questionable practical interpretation of the separation theorem - this theory still provides the ultimate performance limits for any practical system, whether it uses joint source-channel coding or not.  Therefore, the theoretical limits are presented in a self-contained appendix, which is a useful reference also for those not directly interested in the main topic of this book.

                    This book shows how to model selected communication scenarios using game theory. The book helps researchers specifically dealing with scenarios motivated by the increasing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G Communications by using game theory to approach the study of such challenging scenarios. The author explains how game theory acts as a mathematical tool that models decision making in terms of strategies and mechanisms that can result in optimal payoffs for a number of interacting entities, offering often antagonistic behaviors. The book explores new technologies in terms of design, development and management from a theoretical perspective, using game theory to analyze strategic situations and demonstrate profitable behaviors of the cooperative entities. The book identifies and explores several significant applications/uses/situations that arise from the vast deployment of the IoT. The presentation of the technological scenarios is followed in each of the first four chapters by a step-by-step theoretical model often followed by equilibrium proof, and numerical simulation results, that are explained in a tutorial-like manner. The four chapters tackle challenging IoT and 5G related issues, including: new security threats that IoT brings, e.g. botnets, ad hoc vehicular networks and the need for trust in vehicular communications, content repetition by offloading traffic onto mobile users, as well as issues due to new wearable devices that enable data collection to become more intrusive.

 The Accessible Guide to Modern Wireless Communication for Undergraduates, Graduates, and Practicing Electrical Engineers    Wireless communication is a critical discipline of electrical engineering and computer science, yet the concepts have remained elusive for students who are not specialists in the area. This text makes digital communication and receiver algorithms for wireless communication broadly accessible to undergraduates, graduates, and practicing electrical engineers. Notably, the book builds on a signal processing foundation and does not require prior courses on analog or digital communication.     Introduction to Wireless Digital Communication  establishes the principles of communication, from a digital signal processing perspective, including key mathematical background, transmitter and receiver signal processing algorithms, channel models, and generalizations to multiple antennas. Robert Heath’s “less is more” approach focuses on typical solutions to common problems in wireless engineering.   Heath presents digital communication fundamentals from a signal processing perspective, focusing on the complex pulse amplitude modulation approach used in most commercial wireless systems. He describes specific receiver algorithms for implementing wireless communication links, including synchronization, carrier frequency offset estimation, channel estimation, and equalization. While most concepts are presented for systems with single transmit and receive antennas, Heath concludes by extending those concepts to contemporary MIMO systems.   To promote learning, each chapter includes previews, bullet-point summaries, examples, and numerous homework problems to help readers test their knowledge.    Basics of wireless communication: applications, history, and the central role of signal processing Digital communication essentials: components, channels, distortion, coding/decoding, encryption, and modulation/demodulation Signal processing: linear time invariant systems, probability/random processes, Fourier transforms, derivation of complex baseband signal representation and equivalent channels, and multi-rate signal processing Least-squared estimation techniques that build on the linear algebra typically taught to electrical engineering undergraduates Complex pulse amplitude modulation: symbol mapping, constellations, signal bandwidth, and noise Synchronization, including symbol, frame, and carrier frequency offset Frequency selective channel estimation and equalization MIMO techniques using multiple transmit and/or receive antennas, including SIMO, MISO, and MIMO-OFDM     Register your product at informit.com/register for convenient access to downloads, updates, and corrections as they become available.

                    Chöying Tobden Dorje's magnum opus presented in English for the first time, in an authoritative translation prepared under the auspices of well-known and highly respected Tibetan teachers and translators.


In 1838, Choying Tobden Dorje, a yogin and scholar of northeastern Tibet, completed a multivolume masterwork that traces the entire path of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism from beginning to end. Written by a mantra practitioner for the benefit of mantra practitioners living among the lay community, it was intended to be informative, inspirational, and above all, practical. Its twenty-five books, or topical divisions, offer a comprehensive and detailed view of the Buddhist path according to the early translation school of Tibetan Buddhism, spanning the vast range of Buddhist teachings from the initial steps to the highest esoteric teachings of great perfection. Choying Tobden Dorje’s magnum opus appears in English here for the first time.

Book 13 presents the philosophical systems of India and Tibet, according to the writings of Longchen Rabjam and the revelations of Orgyan Lingpa. First, it discusses the views attributed to classical Hinduism, Jainism, materialism, and nihilism. Second, it describes the standpoints of the Vaibhashika and Sautrantika exponents of the lesser vehicle, exemplified by pious attendants and hermit buddhas, and the Cittamatra (“mind only”) and Madhyamaka (“middle way”) commentators of the great vehicle, exemplified by great bodhisattva beings. Third, it analyzes the inner and outer vehicles of the Buddhist tantras, with an emphasis on the three classes of the great perfection. Fourth, it documents the lines of philosophical transmission within Tibet, including Bon, Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, Kadampa, and Geluk. It concludes with an extract from a well-known treatise of the Fifth Dalai Lama, applying the techniques of consequential reasoning to the first chapter of Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Phenomenology.

Review
""This monumental treatise, covering both common and esoteric Buddhist lore, was composed by Choying Tobden Dorje, a most illustrious scholar and accomplished sage. Fortunately, among his voluminous books, this, his masterwork, has survived and has been carefully translated true to the original. It will open the eyes of serious readers to the vast spectrum of Buddhist wisdom."" Tulku Thondup""

                    The evaluation of electromagnetic field coupling to transmission lines is animportant problem in electromagnetic compatibility. The use of the transmission line (TL) approximation theory has permitted the solution of a large range of problems (e. g. lightning and EMP interaction with power lines). However, the continual increase in operating frequency of products and higher-frequency sources of disturbances (such as UWB systems) makes TL basic assumptions no longer acceptable for a certain number of applications. In the last decade or so, the generalization of classical TL theory to take into account high frequency effects has emerged as an important topic of study in electromagnetic compatibility. This effort resulted in the elaboration ofthe so-called ""generalized"" or ""full-wave"" TL theory, which incorporates high frequency radiation effects, while keeping the relative simplicity of TL equations.This book is organized in two main parts. Part I presents consolidatedknowledge of classical transmission line theory and differentfield-to-transmission line coupling models. Part II presents differentapproaches developed to generalize TL Theory.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/1227911/4e9c89,280,WIT Press / Computational Mechanics,2008,english,"PDF, 3.96 MB"

                    In the last 30 years there have been dramatic changes in electrical technology--yet the length of the undergraduate curriculum has remained four years.  Until some ten years ago, the analysis of transmission lines was a standard topic in the EE and CpE undergraduate curricula.  Today most of the undergraduate curricula contain a rather brief study of the analysis of transmission lines in a one-semester junior-level course on electromagnetics. In some schools, this study of transmission lines is relegated to a senior technical elective or has disappeared from the curriculum altogether.  This raises a serious problem in the preparation of EE and CpE undergraduates to be competent in the modern industrial world.  For the reasons mentioned above, today's undergraduates lack the basic skills to design high-speed digital and high-frequency analog systems.  It does little good to write sophisticated software if the hardware is unable to process the instructions.  This problem will increase as the speeds and frequencies of these systems continue to increase seemingly without bound.  This book is meant to repair that basic deficiency.Content: Chapter 1 Basic Skills and Concepts Having Application to Transmission Lines (pages 1–48): Chapter 2 Time?Domain Analysis of Two?Conductor Lines (pages 49–120): Chapter 3 Frequency?Domain Analysis of Two?Conductor Lines (pages 121–174): Chapter 4 The Transmission?Line Equations for Three?Conductor Lines (pages 175–206): Chapter 5 Solution of the Transmission?Line Equations for Three?Conductor Lossless Lines (pages 207–238): Chapter 6 Solution of the Transmission?Line Equations for Three?Conductor Lossy Lines (pages 239–271):                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2156728/84185f,306,Unknown,2010,english,"PDF, 12.48 MB"

One of us (FAB) published a book Problems in Electronics with Solutions in 1957 which became well established and ran to five editions, the last revised and enlarged edition appearing in 1976. When the first edition was written it covered almost the complete undergraduate electronics courses in engin­ eering at universities. One book, at a price students can afford, can no longer cover an undergraduate course in electronics. It has therefore been decided to produce a book covering one important section of such a course using the experience gained and a few problems from previous editions of Problems in Electronics with Solutions. The book is based largely on problems collected by us over many years and given to undergraduate electronic and electrical engineers. Its purpose is to present the problems, together with a large number of their solutions, in the hope that it will prove valuable to undergraduates and other teachers. It should also be useful for Master's degree students in electronic and electrical engineering and physics, research workers, engineers and scientists in industry and as a reference source.

Transmission Lines in Digital Systems for EMC Practitioners,Clayton R. Paul(auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/57/b8/1c/57b81c8d1b3805bbb07529efae4cd1a7.jpg,"
                    This is a brief but comprehensive book covering the set of EMC skills that EMC practitioners today require in order to be successful in high-speed, digital electronics.  The basic skills in the book are new and weren’t studied in most curricula some ten years ago.  The rapidly changing digital technology has created this demand for a discussion of new analysis skills particularly for the analysis of transmission lines where the conductors that interconnect the electronic modules have become “electrically large,” longer than a tenth of a wavelength, which are increasingly becoming important.  Crosstalk between the lines is also rapidly becoming a significant problem in getting modern electronic systems to work satisfactorily.  Hence this text concentrates on the modeling of “electrically large” connection conductors where previously-used Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws and lumped-circuit modeling have become obsolete because of the increasing speeds of modern digital systems.  This has caused an increased emphasis on Signal Integrity. Until as recently as some ten years ago, digital system clock speeds and data rates were in the hundreds of megahertz (MHz) range.  Prior to that time, the “lands” on printed circuit boards (PCBs) that interconnect the electronic modules had little or no impact on the proper functioning of those electronic circuits.  Today, the clock and data speeds have moved into the low gigahertz (GHz) range.Content: Chapter 1 Transmission Lines: Physical Dimensions vs. Electric Dimensions (pages 1–29): Chapter 2 Time?Domain Analysis of Two?Conductor Lines (pages 31–101): Chapter 3 Frequency?Domain Analysis of Two?Conductor Lines (pages 103–123): Chapter 4 Crosstalk in Three?Conductor Lines (pages 125–154): Chapter 5 The Approximate Inductive–Capacitive Crosstalk Model (pages 155–209): Chapter 6 The Exact Crosstalk Prediction Model (pages 211–244):                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2156729/378c2c,275,Unknown,2011,english,"PDF, 13.69 MB"

Antenna Engineering : Theory and Problems,Levin,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/ce/4e/ce/ce4eceaa069e5eb114d2ebfef056e267.jpg,"
The book deals with theoretical and experimental research of antennas. The presentation is based on the electromagnetic theory. It begins with the theory of thin antennas. Thin antennas represent one of the main types of radiators, thus the theory of thin antennas is the basis of the antennas analysis.  Special attention is paid to the integral equation of Leontovich-Levin for a current along a straight thin-walled metal cylinder, which is equivalent to the equation of Hallen with a precise kernel. Together with the analysis of various types of antennas, the book deals with the problems of synthesis including the creation a wide-band radiator by means of determining of the types and the magnitudes of concentrated loads, which are connected along a linear radiator and create in a given frequency band high electrical performance.  Problems of antenna engineering are discussed in the second half of the book, including the results of application of a compensation method for the protection of humans against irradiation and structural features of ship antennas.

                    This book describes a new concept for analyzing RF/microwave circuits, which includes RF/microwave antennas. The book is unique in its emphasis on practical and innovative microwave RF engineering applications. The analysis is based on nonlinear dynamics and chaos models and shows comprehensive benefits and results. All conceptual RF microwave circuits and antennas are innovative and can be broadly implemented in engineering applications.Given the dynamics of RF microwave circuits and antennas, they are suitable for use in a broad range of applications. The book presents analytical methods for microwave RF antennas and circuit analysis, concrete examples, and geometric examples. The analysis is developed systematically, starting with basic differential equations and their bifurcations, and subsequently moving on to fixed point analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations.Engineering applications include microwave RF circuits and antennas in a variety of topological structures, RFID ICs and antennas, microstrips, circulators, cylindrical RF network antennas, Tunnel Diodes (TDs), bipolar transistors, field effect transistors (FETs), IMPATT amplifiers, Small Signal (SS) amplifiers, Bias-T circuits, PIN diode circuits, power amplifiers, oscillators, resonators, filters, N-turn antennas, dual spiral coil antennas, helix antennas, linear dipole and slot arrays, and hybrid translinear circuits. In each chapter, the concept is developed from the basic assumptions up to the final engineering outcomes. The scientific background is explained at basic and advanced levels and closely integrated with mathematical theory.The book also includes a wealth of examples, making it ideal for intermediate graduate level studies. It is aimed at electrical and electronic engineers, RF and microwave engineers, students and researchers in physics, and will also greatly benefit all engineers who have had no formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desire to bridge the gap between innovative microwave RF circuits and antennas and advanced mathematical analysis methods.

Wireless ad hoc networks, mobile or static, have special resource requirements and topology features, which make them different from classic computer networks in resource management, routing, media access control, and QoS provisioning. Some of our day-to-day situations directly relate to ad hoc wireless network applications, such as self-organization, mobility management, and energy efficient design.Within thirteen self-contained chapters, this volume provides a complete survey of the state-of-the-art research that encompasses all areas of ad hoc and sensor networks. Written by distinguished researchers in the field, these chapters focus on the theoretical and experimental study of advanced research topics involving security and trust, broadcasting and multicasting, power control and energy efficiency, and QoS provisioning.This book is a great reference tool for graduate students, researchers, and mathematicians interested in studying mobile ad hoc and sensor networks.

Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks,Dr Paolo Santi,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/30/2b/9b/302b9ba284616a6d691903f574003a33.jpg,"
Topology control is fundamental to solving  scalability and capacity problems in large-scale wireless ad hoc and sensor networks.          Forthcoming wireless multi-hop networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks will allow network nodes to control the communication topology by choosing their transmitting ranges. Briefly,  topology control  (TC) is the art of co-ordinating nodes’ decisions regarding their transmitting ranges, to generate a network with the desired features.  Building an optimized network topology helps surpass the prevalent scalability and capacity problems.         Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks  makes the case for topology control and provides an exhaustive coverage of TC techniques in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, considering both stationary networks, to which most of the existing solutions are tailored, and mobile networks. The author introduces a new taxonomy of topology control and gives a full explication of the applications and challenges of this important topic.         Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks:        Defines topology control and explains its necessity, considering both stationary and mobile networks.      Describes the most representative TC protocols and their performance.      Covers the critical transmitting range for stationary and mobile networks, topology optimization problems such as energy efficiency, and distributed topology control.      Discusses implementation and ‘open issues’, including realistic models and the effect of multi-hop data traffic.      Presents a case study on routing protocol design, to demonstrate how TC can ease the design of cooperative routing protocols.           This invaluable text will provide graduate students in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics and Physics, researchers in the field of ad hoc networking, and professionals in wireless telecoms as well as networking system developers with a single reference resource on topology control.
