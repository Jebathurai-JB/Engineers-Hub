Asynchronous Operators of Sequential Logic: Venjunction & Sequention: Digital Circuit Analysis and Design ,Vadim Vasyukevich (auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/34/46/99/34469942e2b11ca3b0fef306b78fbf09.jpg,"
This book is dedicated to new mathematical instruments assigned for logical modeling of the memory of digital devices. The case in point is logic-dynamical operation named venjunction and venjunctive function as well as sequention and sequentional function. Venjunction and sequention operate within the framework of sequential logic. In a form of the corresponding equations, they organically fit analytical expressions of Boolean algebra. Thus, a sort of symbiosis is formed using elements of asynchronous sequential logic on the one hand and combinational logic on the other hand. So, asynchronous logic is represented in the form of enhanced Boolean logic. The book contains initial concepts, fundamental definitions, statements, principles and rules needed for theoretical justification of the mathematical apparatus and its validity for asynchronous logic. Asynchronous operators named venjunctor and sequentor are designed for practical implementation. These basic elements are assigned for realizing of memory functions in sequential circuits. Present research work is the final stage of generalization and systematization of all those ideas and investigations, author’s interest to which alternately flashed up and faded over many years and for various reasons until formed “critical mass”, and all findings were arranged definitively as a mathematical basis of a theory appropriately associated under a common theme – asynchronous sequential logic, essentially classified as switching logic, which falls into category of algebraic logics.

The omnipresence of electronic devices in our everyday lives has been accompanied by the downscaling of chip feature sizes and the ever increasing complexity of digital circuits. This book is devoted to the analysis and design of digital circuits, where the signal can assume only two possible logic levels. It deals with the basic principles and concepts of digital electronics. It addresses all aspects of combinational logic and provides a detailed understanding of logic gates that are the basic components in the implementation of circuits used to perform functions and operations of Boolean algebra. Combinational logic circuits are characterized by outputs that depend only on the actual input values. Efficient techniques to derive logic equations are proposed together with methods of analysis and synthesis of combinational logic circuits.

                    The main focus of this book is to provide the reader with a deep understanding of modeling and design strategies of Current-Mode digital circuits, as well as to organize in a coherent manner all the original and powerful authors’ results in the domain of Current-Mode digital circuits.   Model and Design of Bipolar and MOS Current-Mode Logic includes bipolar Current-Mode digital circuits, which emerged as an approach to realize digital circuits with the highest speed, and CMOS Current-Mode digital circuits, which together with its speed performance has been rediscovered to allow logic gates implementations having the feature of low noise level generation.   Model and Design of Bipolar and MOS Current-Mode Logic allows the reader not only to understand the operating principle and the features of bipolar and MOS Current-Mode digital circuits, but also to design optimized digital gates. And, although the material is presented in a formal and theoretical manner, much emphasis is devoted to a design perspective. Moreover, to further link the book’s theoretical aspects with practical issues, and to provide the reader with an idea of the real order of magnitude involved assuming actual technologies, numerical examples together with SPICE simulations are included in the book.  Model and Design of Bipolar and MOS Current-Mode Logic can be used as a reference to practicing engineers working in this area and as text book to senior undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students (already familiar with electronic circuits and logic gates) who want to extend their knowledge and cover all aspects of the analysis and design of Current-Mode digital circuits.

Pragmatic Logic (Synthesis Lectures on Digital Circuits and Systems),William J. Eccles,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/c4/f7/44/c4f74426596237055b9e96f5d1015867.jpg,"
                    Pragmatic Logic presents the analysis and design of digital logic systems. The author begins with a brief study of binary and hexadecimal number systems and then looks at the basics of Boolean algebra. The study of logic circuits is divided into two parts, combinational logic, which has no memory, and sequential logic, which does. Numerous examples highlight the principles being presented. The text ends with an introduction to digital logic design using Verilog, a hardware description language. The chapter on Verilog can be studied along with the other chapters in the text. After the reader has completed combinational logic in Chapters 4 and 5, sections 9.1 and 9.2 would be appropriate. Similarly, the rest of Chapter 9 could be studied after completing sequential logic in Chapters 6 and 7. This short lecture book will be of use to students at any level of electrical or computer engineering and for practicing engineers or scientists in any field looking for a practical and applied introduction to digital logic. The authors pragmatic and applied style gives a unique and helpful non-idealist, practical, opinionate introduction to digital systems.

                    Systems are subject to faults in their components, affecting   their overall behaviour. In a 'black-box' system, such faults only become   apparent in the output when appropriate inputs are given, which poses a   number of satisfaction and optimisation problems regarding both testing and   diagnosing. In this dissertation we address such problems, developing   models with multi-valued logics that we formalise and generalise to   multiple faults. Such logics extend Boolean logic by encoding dependencies   on faults, thus allowing the modelling of an arbitrary number of diagnostic   theories. The effectiveness of constraint solving over finite domains and   sets is shown on several of the above problems.

This established, didactically excellent textbook unifies intuitiveness with extraordinary precision of its terminology and the derivation of concepts. It was developed as manuscript to teach students in electrical engineering, and has served to do so for thousands of students over two decades.Discussed is the electromagnetic field theory and its mathematical methods. Maxwell’s equations are presented and explained. It follows a detailed discussion of electrostatics, flux problems, magnetostatics, quasi stationary fields, and electromagnetic waves.The author presents how to apply numerical methods like finite differences, finite elements, boundary elements, image charge methods, and Monte-Carlo methods to field theory problems. He offers an outlook on fundamental issues in physics including quantum mechanics. Some of these issues concern still unanswered questions. A chapter dedicated to the theory of special relativity, which allows to simplify a number of field theory problems, complements this book.This book’s usefulness is not limited to engineering students, but can also be very helpful for physicists and other branches of science.

Light and Vacuum: The Wave Particle Nature of the Light and the Quantum Vacuum. Electromagnetic Theory and Quantum Electrodynamics Beyond the Standard Model,Constantin Meis,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/08/07/35/080735edacb2c5ac1c80ab5a7824c10e.jpg,"
Light and Vacuum presents a synthesis of selected fundamental topics of electromagnetic wave theory and quantum electrodynamics (QED) and analyzes the main theoretical difficulties encountered to ensure a coherent mathematical description of the simultaneous wave–particle nature of light, put in evidence by the experiments. The notion and the role of the quantum vacuum, strongly related to light, are extensively investigated.  Classical electrodynamics issued from Maxwell's equations revealed the necessity of introducing the notion of volume for an electromagnetic wave to stand entailing precise values of cut-off wavelengths to account for the shape and dimensions of the surrounding space. Conversely, in QED, light is considered to be composed of point particles disregarding the conceptual question on how the frequency of oscillating electric and magnetic fields may be attributed to a point particle. To conciliate these concepts, the book provides a comprehensive overview of the author's work, including innovative contributions on the quantization of the vector potential amplitude at a single photon state, the non-local simultaneous wave–particle mathematical representation of the photon and finally the quantum vacuum. The purpose of the advanced elaborations is to raise questions, give hints and answers, and finally aspire for further theoretical and experimental studies in order to improve our knowledge and understanding on the real essence of Light and Vacuum.  In this new edition, the bibliography has been widely enriched. Improvements have been made to the various chapters, taking into account the actual status of the knowledge in this field.

                    I'm writing this review to bolster the review written by glires. I believe that glires's review is very accurate. This book assumes the reader already has a working knowledge of electromagnetism.
This is not a book for self-study. If you want a self study book (or a light reference), I would recommend using David J. Griffiths book or some other book for introductory EMAG. (The book I originally learned from is no longer in print so I can't really recommend it).
That being said, once you get into chapter 3, the book is excellent. This book also uses the paradigm that solving problems is how you learn the theory. So, as glires noted, much of the proofing is left for you to do in the problems at the end of each chapter.
Also as glires noted, this is not a useful reference. There is no single location where all constants and formulas are listed.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/705908/fae6d3,390,Addison Wesley,1992,english,"DJVU, 27.70 MB"

This book is a self contained course in electromagnetic theory suitable for senior physics and electrical engineering students as well as graduate students whose past has not prepared them well for books such as Jackson or Landau and Lifschitz. The text is liberally sprinkled with worked examples illustrating the application of the theory to various physical problems. This new edition features improved accuracy and readability, added and further clarified examples, plus additional sections on Schwarz-Christoffel mappings. Making the book more self sufficient, an appendix on orthogonal function expansions and the derivation of Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials as well as derivation of their generating functions are each included. The number of exercises has also been increased by 45 over the previous edition. This book stresses the unity of electromagnetic theory with electric and magnetic fields developed in parallel. SI units are used throughout and considerable use is made of tensor notation and the Levi-Cevita symbol. To more closely display the parallelism, extensive use is made of the scalar magnetic potential particularly in dealing with the Laplace and Poisson equation. 85 worked problems illustrate the theory. Conformal mappings are dealt with in some detail. Relevant mathematical material is provided in appendices.

Engineers and scientists who develop and install electronic devices and circuits need to have a solid understanding of electromagnetic theory and the electromagnetic behavior of devices and circuits. In particular, they must be well-versed in electromagnetic compatibility, which minimizes and controls the side effects of interconnected electric devices.  Designed to entice the practical engineer to explore some worthwhile mathematical methods, and to reorient the theoretical scientist to industrial applications, Electromagnetic Theory for Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineers is based on the author’s courses taught in industrial settings. The book is a mathematically rigorous exposition of electromagnetic theory with applications in electromagnetic compatibility and high-speed digital design.   The topics—ranging from Maxwell's theory and multi-conductor transmission line theory to S-matrix, antenna theory, and dielectric breakdown—were chosen because they have direct relevance to current electromagnetic compatibility problems encountered in the real world. With many worked examples and problem sets, the book relates the theory to practical experiences faced by practitioners. It is written both for physicists and mathematicians new to the field of electromagnetic compatibility and high-speed digital design, as well as established researchers in the field. It is also designed as an advanced undergraduate textbook for a course in electromagnetic theory. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2328055/784eda,Unknown,CRC Press,2013,english,"PDF, 7.20 MB"

Basic Electromagnetic Theoryis designed as a concise introduction to electromagnetic field theory emphasizing the physical foundations of the subject. It is aimed at both undergraduates and interested laypersons. It has been based on the author's experience both as a former field theorist (working on quantum electrodynamics) and currently as an applied optical physicist. As such, it covers much material from the standard university syllabus. It also develops a number of themes in greater detail, so as to cover a number of non-standard topics that provide a fuller understanding of the subject. A key aspect to the book is the macroscopic approach to the subject from the outset. Most readers will have some familiarity with the standard mathematics employed, but a review chapter is provided at the beginning to help give some guidance on these topics as they are used throughout the book.Features:-Designed as a concise introduction to electromagnetic field theory emphasizing the physical foundations of the subject-Covers a number of non-standard topics that provide a fuller understanding of the subject ",https://1lib.in/dl/3705322/484f90,176,Mercury Learning & Information,2016,english,"EPUB, 11.20 MB"

This book, Electronic Devices and Circuit Application, is the first of four books of a larger work, Fundamentals of Electronics. It is comprised of four chapters describing the basic operation of each of the four fundamental building blocks of modern electronics: operational amplifiers, semiconductor diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and field effect transistors. Attention is focused on the reader obtaining a clear understanding of each of the devices when it is operated in equilibrium. Ideas fundamental to the study of electronic circuits are also developed in the book at a basic level to lessen the possibility of misunderstandings at a higher level. The difference between linear and non-linear operation is explored through the use of a variety of circuit examples including amplifiers constructed with operational amplifiers as the fundamental component and elementary digital logic gates constructed with various transistor types. Fundamentals of Electronics has been designed primarily for use in an upper division course in electronics for electrical engineering students. Typically such a course spans a full academic years consisting of two semesters or three quarters. As such, Electronic Devices and Circuit Applications, and the following two books, Amplifiers: Analysis and Design and Active Filters and Amplifier Frequency Response, form an appropriate body of material for such a course. Secondary applications include the use in a one-semester electronics course for engineers or as a reference for practicing engineers.

                    PSpice for Circuit Theory and Electronic Devices is one of a series of five PSpice books and introduces the latest Cadence Orcad PSpice version 10.5 by simulating a range of DC and AC exercises. It is aimed primarily at those wishing to get up to speed with this version but will be of use to high school students, undergraduate students, and of course, lecturers. Circuit theorems are applied to a range of circuits and the calculations by hand after analysis are then compared to the simulated results. The Laplace transform and the s-plane are used to analyze CR and LR circuits where transient signals are involved. Here, the Probe output graphs demonstrate what a great learning tool PSpice is by providing the reader with a visual verification of any theoretical calculations. Series and parallel-tuned resonant circuits are investigated where the difficult concepts of dynamic impedance and selectivity are best understood by sweeping different circuit parameters through a range of values.    Obtaining semiconductor device characteristics as a laboratory exercise has fallen out of favour of late, but nevertheless, is still a useful exercise for understanding or modelling semiconductor devices. Inverting and non-inverting operational amplifiers characteristics such as gain-bandwidth are investigated and we will see the dependency of bandwidth on the gain using the performance analysis facility. Power amplifiers are examined where PSpice/Probe demonstrates very nicely the problems of cross-over distortion and other problems associated with power transistors. We examine power supplies and the problems of regulation, ground bounce, and power factor correction. Lastly, we look at MOSFET device characteristics and show how these devices are used to form basic CMOS logic gates such as NAND and NOR gates.

The Physics of Oscillations and Waves: With Applications in Electricity and Mechanics,Ingram Bloch (auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/59/97/4b/59974b05e6f0e77203f8394207f85cd4.jpg,"
Except for digressions in Chapters 8 and 17, this book is a highly unified treatment of simple oscillations and waves. The phenomena treated are ""simple"" in that they are de­ scribable by linear equations, almost all occur in one dimension, and the dependent variables are scalars instead of vectors or something else (such as electromagnetic waves) with geometric complications. The book omits such complicated cases in order to deal thoroughly with properties shared by all linear os­ cillations and waves. The first seven chapters are a sequential treatment of electrical and mechanical oscillating systems, starting with the simplest and proceeding to systems of coupled oscillators subjected to ar­ bitrary driving forces. Then, after a brief discussion of nonlinear oscillations in Chapter 8, the concept of normal modes of motion is introduced and used to show the relationship between os­ cillations and waves. After Chapter 12, properties of waves are explored by whatever mathematical techniques are applicable.

Electromagnetic Field Interaction with Transmission Lines : From Classical Theory to HF Radiation Effects (Advances in Electrical Engineering and Electromagnetics) ,F. Rachidi,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/44/ad/34/44ad343cb536585fc616eaafcc7de5e5.jpg,"
                    The evaluation of electromagnetic field coupling to transmission lines is animportant problem in electromagnetic compatibility. The use of the transmission line (TL) approximation theory has permitted the solution of a large range of problems (e. g. lightning and EMP interaction with power lines). However, the continual increase in operating frequency of products and higher-frequency sources of disturbances (such as UWB systems) makes TL basic assumptions no longer acceptable for a certain number of applications. In the last decade or so, the generalization of classical TL theory to take into account high frequency effects has emerged as an important topic of study in electromagnetic compatibility. This effort resulted in the elaboration ofthe so-called ""generalized"" or ""full-wave"" TL theory, which incorporates high frequency radiation effects, while keeping the relative simplicity of TL equations.This book is organized in two main parts. Part I presents consolidatedknowledge of classical transmission line theory and differentfield-to-transmission line coupling models. Part II presents differentapproaches developed to generalize TL Theory.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/1227911/bbabf2,280,WIT Press / Computational Mechanics,2008,english,"PDF, 3.96 MB"

                    The excitement and the glitz of mechatronics has shifted the engineering community’s attention away from fluid power systems in recent years. However, fluid power still remains advantageous in many applications compared to electrical or mechanical power transmission methods. Designers are left with few practical resources to help in the design and analysis of fluid power systems, especially when approaching fluid power for the first time.
Helping you overcome these hurdles, Hydraulic Power System Analysis demonstrates modern computer-aided analytical techniques used to model nonlinear, dynamic fluid power systems. Following an overview of fluid power, the authors examine various relevant fluid properties, energy calculations, and steady state and dynamic analysis along with a review of automatic control theory. Turning to modeling, the next few chapters address valves and motors and then apply dynamic modeling to examples relating to pumps, hydrostatic transmissions, and valves. The book includes a unique chapter showing how to combine flow resistance equations with the differential equations governing dynamic system performance. The final chapter translates electrical circuit theory concepts to noise attenuation in fluid power systems.
Illustrated with many equations, practical computer modeling examples, and exercises, Hydraulic Power System Analysis provides a much-needed modernization of dynamic modeling for fluid power systems using powerful computational tools.

Chapter 1 has been therefore, enlarged and completely rewritten. In addition, the influences of environmental constraints are also discussed.The present edition, like the earlier two, is designed for a two-semester course at the undergraduate level or for first-semester post-graduate study.Modern power systems have grown larger and spread over larger geographical area with many interconnections between neighbouring systems. Optimal planning, operation and control of such large-scale systems require advanced computer-based techniques many of which are explained in the student-oriented and reader-friendly manner by means of numerical examples throughout this book. Electric utility engineers will also be benefitted by the book as it will prepare them more adequately to face the new challenges. The style of writing is amenable to self-study. The wide range of topics facilitates versatile selection of chapters and sections for completion in the semester time frame.Highlights of this edition are the five new chapters. Chapter 13 deals with power system security. Contingency analysis and sensitivity factors are described. An analytical framework is developed to control bulk power systems in such a way that security is enhanced. Everything seems to have a propensity to fail. Power systems are no exception. Power system security practices try to control and operate power systems in a defensive posture so that the effects of these inevitable failures are minimized.Chapter 14 is an introduction to the use of state estimation in electric power systems. We have selected Least Squares Estimation to give basic solution. External system equivalencing and treatment of bad data are also discussed.The economics of power transmission has always lured the planners to transmit as much power as possible through existing transmission lines. Difficulty of acquiring the right of way for new lines (the corridor crisis) has always motivated the power engineers to develop compensatory systems. Therefore, Chapter 15 addresses compensation in power systems. Both series and shunt compensation of lines have been thoroughly discussed. Concepts of SVS, STATCOM and FACTS have-been briefly introduced.Chapter 16 covers the important topic of load forecasting technique. Knowing load is absolutely essential for solving any power system problem.Chapter 17 deals with the important problem of voltage stability. Mathematical formulation, analysis, state-of-art, future trends and challenges are discussed.MATLAB and SIMULINK, ideal programs for power system analysis are included in this book as an appendix along with 18 solved examples illustrating their use in solving representative power system problems. The help rendered by Shri Sunil Bhat of VNIT, Nagpur in writing this appendix is thankfully acknowledged.Tata McGraw-Hill and the authors would like to thank the following reviewers of this edition: Prof. J.D.

The code is embedded in the text, helping readers to put into practice the ideas and methods discussed.The book primarily focuses on filter banks, wavelets, and images. While the Fourier transform is adequate for periodic signals, wavelets are more suitable for other cases, such as short-duration signals: bursts, spikes, tweets, lung sounds, etc. Both Fourier and wavelet transforms decompose signals into components. Further, both are also invertible, so the original signals can be recovered from their components. Compressed sensing has emerged as a promising idea. One of the intended applications is networked devices or sensors, which are now becoming a reality; accordingly, this topic is also addressed. A selection of experiments that demonstrate image denoising applications are also included. In the interest of reader-friendliness, the longer programs have been grouped in an appendix; further, a second appendix on optimization has been added to supplement the content of the last chapter.

PROs and CONs of each simulator are analyzed, and it is clearly indicated which kind of answers each of them can give and at a what price. It is explained, that speed and precision do not go hand in hand, and it is important to understand when to simulate what, and with which tool. Being able to simulate SSD’s performances is mandatory to meet time-to-market, together with product cost and quality. Over the last few years the authors developed an advanced simulator named “SSDExplorer” which has been used to evaluate multiple phenomena with great accuracy, from QoS (Quality Of Service) to Read Retry, from LDPC Soft Information to power, from Flash aging to FTL. SSD simulators are also addressed in a broader context in this book, i.e. the analysis of what happens when SSDs are connected to the OS (Operating System) and to the end-user application (for example, a database search). The authors walk the reader through the full simulation flow of a real system-level by combining SSD Explorer with the QEMU virtual platform. The reader will be impressed by the level of know-how and the combination of models that such simulations are asking for.

                    This book explores the implementation of MATLAB(R) and Simulink(R) in the development of embedded robust control systems. Robust control theory allows for changes in a system whilst maintaining stability and performance. Applications of this technique are very important for dependable embedded systems, making technologies such as drones and other autonomous systems with sophisticated embedded controllers and systems relatively common-place.Three extended case studies are developed in depth: embedded control of a tank physical model; robust control of a miniature helicopter; and robust control of two-wheeled robots. These are taken from the area of motion control but the book may be also used by designers in other areas.Some knowledge of linear control theory is assumed and experience of C programming is desirable but to make the book accessible to engineers new to the field and to students, the authors avoid complicated mathematical proofs and overwhelming computer architecture technical details. All programs used in the examples and case studies will be freely downloadable to help with the assimilation of the book contents.This book is essential reading for engineers, developers, designers, industrial practitioners, scientists, and researchers in Control, Automation, Robotics, Mechatronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computing, and Electronics (with a focus on robust control systems and the design, modelling and implementation of embedded systems).

                    This book, now in its fourth edition, is the second in a series of three books that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to ARM® Cortex™-M microcontrollers. The three books are primarily written for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students. They could also be used for professionals learning the ARM platform. The first book Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM® Cortex™-M Microcontrollers is an introduction to computers and interfacing focusing on assembly language and C programming. This second book focuses on interfacing and the design of embedded systems. The third book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM® Cortex™-M Microcontrollers is an advanced book focusing on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics.   An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. Topics include microcontrollers, design, verification, hardware/software synchronization, interfacing devices to the computer, timing diagrams, real-time systems, data collection and processing, motor control, analog filters, digital filters, and real-time signal processing.In general, the area of embedded systems is an important and growing discipline within electrical and computer engineering. The educational market of embedded system is dominated by simple microcontrollers like the PIC, 9S12, and 8051. This is because of their market share, low cost, and historical dominance. However, as problems become more complex, so must the systems that solve them. A number of embedded system paradigms must shift in order to accommodate this growth in complexity. First, the number of calculations per second will increase from about 1 million/sec to 1 billion/sec. Similarly, the number of lines of software code will also increase from 1000’s to 10 to 100 million. Thirdly, systems will involve multiple microcontrollers supporting many simultaneous operations. Lastly, the need for system verification will continue to grow as these systems are deployed into safety critical applications. These changes are more than a simple growth in size and bandwidth. These systems must employ parallel programming, DMA synchronization, real-time operating systems, fault tolerant design, priority interrupt handling, and networking. Consequently, it will be important to provide our students with these types of design experiences. The ARM platform is both low cost and provides the high performance features required in future embedded systems. The ARM market share is currently large and growing. Furthermore, students trained on the ARM will be equipped to design systems across the complete spectrum from simple to complex. The purpose of writing this book at this time is to bring engineering education into the 21st century.This book employs many approaches to learning. It will not include an exhaustive recapitulation of the information in data sheets. First, it begins with basic fundamentals, which allows the reader to solve new problems with new technology. Second, the book presents many detailed design examples. These examples illustrate the process of design. There are multiple structural components that assist learning. Checkpoints, with answers in the back, are short easy to answer questions providing immediate feedback while reading. Simple homework, with answers to the odd questions on the web, provide more detailed learning opportunities. The book includes an index and a glossary so that information can be searched. The most important learning experience in a class like this are of course the laboratories. Each chapter has suggested lab assignments. More detailed lab descriptions are available on the web.The book will cover embedded systems for the ARM® Cortex™-M with specific details on the LM3S811, LM3S1968,TM4C123 and TM4C1294.  Although the solutions are specific for the TI LM3S and TM4C, it will be possible to use this book for other ARM derivatives.

Real-time embedded systems have applications in various industries, from automotive and aerospace through to laboratory test equipment and consumer electronics. These systems provide consistent and reliable timing and are designed to run without intervention for years.
This microcontrollers book starts by introducing you to the concept of RTOS and compares some other alternative methods for achieving real-time performance. Once you've understood the fundamentals, such as tasks, queues, mutexes, and semaphores, you'll learn what to look for when selecting a microcontroller and development environment. By working through examples that use an STM32F7 Nucleo board, the STM32CubeIDE, and SEGGER debug tools, including SEGGER J-Link, Ozone, and SystemView, you'll gain an understanding of preemptive scheduling policies and task communication. The book will then help you develop highly efficient low-level drivers and analyze their real-time performance and CPU utilization. Finally, you'll cover tips for troubleshooting and be able to take your new-found skills to the next level.
By the end of this book, you'll have built on your embedded system skills and will be able to create real-time systems using microcontrollers and FreeRTOS.

Initial material for this book was developed over a period of several years through the introduction in the mid-seventies of a graduate-level course en­ titled, ""Control and Operation of Interconnected Power Systems,"" at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Subsequent involvement with the utility industry and in teaching continuing education courses on modern power sys­ tem control and operation contributed to the complimentary treatment of the dynamic aspects of this overall topic. In effect, we have evolved a textbook that provides a thorough under­ standing of fudamentals as needed by a graduate student with a prior back­ ground in power systems analysis at the undergraduate level, and in system theory concepts normally provided at the beginning of the graduate level in electrical engineering. It is also designed to provide the depth needed both by the serious graduate student and the power industry engineer involved in the activities of energy control centers and short-term operations planning. As explained in Chapter 2, the entire book can be covered in a two­ quarter course sequence. The bulk of the material may be covered in one semester. For a two-semester offering, we recommend that students be in­ volved in some project work to further their depth of understanding. Utility and consulting industry engineers should concentrate on the more advanced concepts and developments usually available at the latter half of each chap­ ter.

                    Renewable Energy (RE) sources differ from conventional sources in that, generally they cannot be scheduled, they are much smaller than conventional power stations and are often connected to the electricity distribution system rather than the transmission system.  The integration of such time variable ‘distributed’ or ‘embedded’ sources into electricity networks requires special consideration. This new book addresses these special issues and covers the following:The characteristics of conventional and RE generators with particular reference to the variable nature of RE from wind, solar, small hydro and marine sources over time scales ranging from seconds to monthsThe power balance and frequency stability in a network with increasing inputs from variable sources and the technical and economic implications of increased penetration from such sources  with special reference to demand side managementThe conversion of energy into electricity from RE sources and the type and characteristics of generators usedThe requirement to condition the power from RE sources and the type and mode of operation of the power electronic converters used to interface such generators to the gridThe flow of power over networks supplied from conventional plus RE sources with particular reference to voltage control and protectionThe economics and trading of ‘green’ electricity in national and international deregulated marketsThe expected developments in RE technology and the future shape of power systems where the penetration from RE sources is large and where substantial operational and control benefits will be   derived from extensive use of power electronic interfaces and controllersThe text is designed to be intelligible to readers who have little previous knowledge of electrical engineering. The more analytical electrical aspects are relegated to an Appendix for readers who wish to gain a more in depth  understanding. The book’s flexible structure makes its accessible to the general engineer or scientists but also caters for readers with a non-scientific background.

This book features cutting-edge research presented at the second international conference on Artificial Intelligence in Renewable Energetic Systems, IC-AIRES2018, held on 24–26 November 2018, at the High School of Commerce, ESC-Koléa in Tipaza, Algeria. Today, the fundamental challenge of integrating renewable energies into the design of smart cities is more relevant than ever. While based on the advent of big data and the use of information and communication technologies, smart cities must now respond to cross-cutting issues involving urban development, energy and environmental constraints; further, these cities must also explore how they can integrate more sustainable energies. Sustainable energies are a major determinant of smart cities’ longevity. From an environmental and technological standpoint, these energies offer an optimal power supply to the electric network while creating significantly less pollution. This requires flexibility, i.e., the availability of supply and demand. The end goal of any smart city is to improve the quality of life for all citizens (both in the city and in the countryside) in a way that is sustainable and respectful of the environment. This book encourages the reader to engage in the preservation of our environment, every moment, every day, so as to help build a clean and healthy future, and to think of the future generations who will one day inherit our planet. Further, it equips those whose work involves energy systems and those engaged in modelling artificial intelligence to combine their expertise for the benefit of the scientific community and humanity as a whole.

                      ""Sustainable Energy and Environment: An Earth System Approach provides a holistic understanding of Earth, energy, and the environment through a careful selection of invited chapters. The book looks at Earth from the perspective of a livable planet and elaborates the surface and subsurface processes and the various energy cycles where energy is transformed and stored in the planet's various spheres. The chapters discuss the interactions between the different parts of Earth-how energy is exchanged between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, and how they impact the environment in which we live. Beginning with an introduction that highlights the strong nexus between Earth, energy, and environment through connectivity and interactivity of natural processes that influence the sustainability of life, the book goes on to discuss Earth in particular-its origin and evolution, its surfaces and rock-forming processes, in the context of past climates, climate changes, and influencing planetary cycles. The volume then focuses on energy-its fundamentals and its various forms. The authors cover conventional and unconventional fossil fuels and renewables and the aspects of energy availability and economics. The fact that energy is central to life and its activities is elaborated in the included chapters. This section reinforces the connection between different energy forms with Earth's surface and subsurface processes. The final section examines the environment- its impact on human health and well-being, climate change and resulting environmental impacts, environmental disasters from exploration, production and usage of energy, and balancing energy usage and its environmental impacts. This holistic approach to the integrated science of earth, energy and environment provides a comprehensive and all-around understanding of the complex planet that is home to mankind. The book is particularly intended for those studying introductory earth sciences, energy fundamentals, and environmental studies. At the same time students in related disciplines, such as ecology, agriculture, petroleum and gas-and indeed all those are interested in Earth, environment, and energy-should find this book as an inviting basic introduction to the interconnectedness of Earth, energy, and the environment. Some of the concepts that are introduced go beyond the general scope of basic courses, making the volume also suitable for more advanced studies.
