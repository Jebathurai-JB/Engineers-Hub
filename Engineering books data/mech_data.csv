Every day, engineers and managers are called upon to understand and execute the terms of construction contracts. Often, these professionals have little or no legal training and find themselves relying upon intuition, common sense or hearsay—with possibly unfortunate and expensive results.In Interpreting Construction Contracts, Thomas and Ellis seek to rescue contractors, project managers, and contract administrators struggling to interpret construction contracts. Using rules set forth by the judiciary and drawing upon decades of legal research and practical experience, the authors discuss the most troublesome contract clauses and present rules to construe them so as to avoid disputes that must be resolved in court. Diagrams, case studies, and more than 70 discussion exercises and solutions are provided to reinforce the principles introduced in each chapter.As clear as it is pragmatic, Interpreting Construction Contracts is a welcome teaching resource and an essential reference for engineers and managers working in the construction industry.

                    Corporate finance theory seeks to understand how incorporated firms address the financial constraints that affect their investment decisions. This is achieved by using varied financial instruments that give holders different claims on the firm's assets. Recent scholarship in this area explores precisely how legal mechanisms affect corporate finance and the development of financial markets. The legal environment is crucially important in explaining the choices that companies make about their capital structure.This book combines company law, capital market regulation and commercial law to give readers a detailed understanding of the legal and regulatory issues relating to corporate financial transactions. Informed by insights from the theoretical and empirical work of financial economists, the book examines, from a legal perspective, key elements of corporate financing structures and capital markets in the UK. The authors' practical experience of transactions and regulatory issues ensures that thorough scholarly inquiry and critical reflection are complemented by an assured understanding of the interface between legal principles and rules as they are documented and in their actual operation.

Advanced Engineering Mathematics with MATLAB, Fourth Edition builds upon three successful previous editions. It is written for today’s STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) student. Three assumptions under lie its structure: (1) All students need a firm grasp of the traditional disciplines of ordinary and partial differential equations, vector calculus and linear algebra. (2) The modern student must have a strong foundation in transform methods because they provide the mathematical basis for electrical and communication studies. (3) The biological revolution requires an understanding of stochastic (random) processes. The chapter on Complex Variables, positioned as the first chapter in previous editions, is now moved to Chapter 10. The author employs MATLAB to reinforce concepts and solve problems that require heavy computation. Along with several updates and changes from the third edition, the text continues to evolve to meet the needs of today’s instructors and students.

There is a large gap between the engineering course in tensor algebra on the one hand and the treatment of linear transformations within classical linear algebra on the other hand. The aim of the book is to bridge this gap by means of the consequent and fundamental exposition. The book is addressed primarily to engineering students with some initial knowledge of matrix algebra. Thereby the mathematical formalism is applied as far as it is absolutely necessary. Numerous exercises provided in the book are accompanied by solutions enabling an autonomous study. The last chapters of the book deal with modern developments in the theory of isotropic an anisotropic tensor functions and their applications to continuum mechanics and might therefore be of high interest for PhD-students and scientists working in this area.  In the last decades, the absolute notation for tensors has become widely accepted and is now a current state of the art for publications in solid and structural mechanics. This is opposed to a majority of books on tensor calculus referring to index notation. The latter one complicates the understanding of the matter especially for readers with initial knowledge. Thus, this book aims at being a modern textbook on tensor calculus for engineers in line with the contemporary way of scientific publications.

Design of Embedded Robust Control Systems Using MATLAB®/Simulink®,Petko Hristov Petkov,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/5f/4a/d0/5f4ad0a074ee211b356373e765a2c8ba.jpg,"
                    This book explores the implementation of MATLAB(R) and Simulink(R) in the development of embedded robust control systems. Robust control theory allows for changes in a system whilst maintaining stability and performance. Applications of this technique are very important for dependable embedded systems, making technologies such as drones and other autonomous systems with sophisticated embedded controllers and systems relatively common-place.Three extended case studies are developed in depth: embedded control of a tank physical model; robust control of a miniature helicopter; and robust control of two-wheeled robots. These are taken from the area of motion control but the book may be also used by designers in other areas.Some knowledge of linear control theory is assumed and experience of C programming is desirable but to make the book accessible to engineers new to the field and to students, the authors avoid complicated mathematical proofs and overwhelming computer architecture technical details. All programs used in the examples and case studies will be freely downloadable to help with the assimilation of the book contents.This book is essential reading for engineers, developers, designers, industrial practitioners, scientists, and researchers in Control, Automation, Robotics, Mechatronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computing, and Electronics (with a focus on robust control systems and the design, modelling and implementation of embedded systems).

                    This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with mathematical theory.In the twenty years since the first edition of this book appeared, the ideas and techniques of nonlinear dynamics and chaos have found application to such exciting new fields as systems biology, evolutionary game theory, and sociophysics. This second edition includes new exercises on these cutting-edge developments, on topics as varied as the curiosities of visual perception and the tumultuous love dynamics inGone With the Wind.

                    In Chemical Engineering Dynamics, the modelling of dynamic chemical engineering processes is presented in a highly understandable way using the unique combination of simplified fundamental theory and direct hands-on computer simulation. The mathematics is kept to a minimum, and yet the nearly 100 examples supplied on a CD-ROM illustrate almost every aspect of chemical engineering science. Each example is described in detail, including the model equations. They are written in the modern user-friendly simulation language Berkeley Madonna, which can be run on both Windows PC and Power-Macintosh computers.Madonna solves models comprising many ordinary differential equations using very simple programming, including arrays. It is so powerful that the model parameters may be defined as ""sliders"", which allow the effect of their change on the model behavior to be seen almost immediately. Data may be included for curve fitting, and sensitivity or multiple runs may be performed. The results can be seen simultaneously on multiple-graph windows or by using overlays. The resultant learning effect of this is tremendous. The examples can be varied to fit any real situation, and the suggested exercises provide practical guidance.The extensive experience of the authors, both in university teaching and international courses, is reflected in this well-balanced presentation, which is suitable for the teacher, the student, the chemist or the engineer. This book provides a greater understanding of the formulation and use of mass and energy balances for chemical engineering, in a most stimulating manner.

                    The idea that “thoughts become things” has become a meme in popular culture. It’s held as a firm proposition in metaphysics, and some spiritual teachers ascribe infinite powers to the mind. But are these claims scientifically accurate? What does the scientific evidence tell us about the scope of the human mind to transform thoughts into reality?New research and new discoveries in epigenetics, neuroscience, electromagnetism, psychology, cymatics (the study of wave phenomena), public health, and quantum physics are demonstrating that thoughts can indeed be profoundly creative. InMind to Matter, award-winning author Dawson Church examines the scientific facts and reviews the studies that show, step by step, exactly how our minds create material form. As each piece of the puzzle falls into place, the science turns out to be even more astonishing than the metaphysics.Throughout the book, Church shares illuminating case histories—up-close, authentic personal accounts of people who had an experience of turning mind into matter. Drawn from the worlds of medicine, sports, business, healing, art, and scientific discovery, these stories run the gamut from profound to inspiring to heart-wrenching. Meticulously researched evidence is presented in highly relatable form, using engaging, understandable, nontechnical analogies. Photos and illustrations enrich the text.As we discover how the universe operates synchronistically, we come to understand that while we have individual local minds, we also participate in universal nonlocal mind.Mind to Mattershows us that as we take charge of our individual power to create, we have the potential, as a species, to catalyze a transformation of our whole world.

Job Hazard Analysis: A Guide for Voluntary Compliance and Beyond, Second Edition, provides a complete reference for performing JHA and setting up a JHA program. The book identifies the basic job steps and tasks, their associated hazards and risks, and safe operating procedures and hazard controls based on this analysis. Authors James Roughton and Nathan Crutchfield argue that the JHA should be the centerpiece of any risk control and occupational safety and health program. However, the traditional JHA has potential problems in gathering and analysis of task data and, with its focus on the sequence of steps, can miss the behavioral effects and the systems interactions between tools, equipment, materials, work environment, management and the individual worker.The concepts are presented for the JHA, incorporating elements from Behavior-Based Safety and Six Sigma. Readers are taken through the whole process of developing tools for identifying workplace hazards, developing systems that support hazard recognition, developing an effective JHA, and managing a JHA based program that can be easily incorporated into occupational safety and health management systems, thus allowing businesses to move from mere compliance to a pro-active safety management. The book is supported by numerous examples of JHAs, end of chapter review questions, sample checklists, action plans, and forms.Provides a basic understanding of the JHA process and a more in-depth background on the human performance improvement for a successful JHA program implementationMethodically develops the risk assessment basics needed within the JHA processPresents expanded resources that are useful in safety systemsIncorporates elements from Behavior-Based Safety and Six Sigma ",https://1lib.in/dl/2716436/c60d3f,504,"Elsevier, Butterworth-Heinemann",2016,english,"PDF, 43.94 MB"

                    For many years, various editions of Smallman's Modern Physical Metallurgy have served throughout the world as a standard undergraduate textbook on metals and alloys. In 1995, it was rewritten and enlarged to encompass the related subject of materials science and engineering and appeared under the title Metals & Materials: Science, Processes, Applications offering a comprehensive amount of a much wider range of engineering materials. Coverage ranged from pure elements to superalloys, from glasses to engineering ceramics, and from everyday plastics to in situ composites, Amongst other favourable reviews, Professor Bhadeshia of Cambridge University commented: ""Given the amount of work that has obviously gone into this book and its extensive comments, it is very attractively priced. It is an excellent book to be recommend strongly for purchase by undergraduates in materials-related subjects, who should benefit greatly by owning a text containing so much knowledge.The book now includes new chapters on materials for sports equipment (golf, tennis, bicycles, skiing, etc.) and biomaterials (replacement joints, heart valves, tissue repair, etc.) - two of the most exciting and rewarding areas in current materials research and development. As in its predecessor, numerous examples are given of the ways in which knowledge of the relation between fine structure and properties has made it possible to optimise the service behaviour of traditional engineering materials and to develop completely new and exciting classes of materials. Special consideration is given to the crucial processing stage that enables materials to be produced as marketable commodities. Whilst attempting to produce a useful and relatively concise survey of key materials and their interrelationships, the authors have tried to make the subject accessible to a wide range of readers, to provide insights into specialised methods of examination and to convey the excitement of the atmosphere in which new materials are conceived and developed.

                    A complete introduction to Sanatana Dharma, the spiritual science of the Hindu sages  • Examines how many core concepts of Hinduism, including Brahman, Atman, bhakti, karma, and reincarnation, relate to modern science  • Explores the scientific discoveries of the rishis, ancient Vedic sages, and how they have only recently been rediscovered by Western scientists  • Reveals the concepts of quantum physics hidden within the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Puranas  Called “the scientists of Hinduism,” the rishis of ancient India were the scribes of the Vedas. They developed the spiritual science of Hinduism, Sanatana Dharma, as their way of ensuring the constant renewal and progress of India’s spiritual tradition and culture. Sanatana Dharma permeates every aspect of Hindu culture, from religion to the arts to the sciences. Woven within its Vedic texts lie all of the essential concepts of quantum physics and other modern scientific discoveries.  Providing a complete introduction to the science of Sanatana Dharma, Vanamali reveals how the core concepts of Hinduism, including Brahman, Atman, bhakti, karma, and reincarnation, relate to modern science and how the scientific discoveries of the ancient rishis have been recently rediscovered by the West. She examines the scientific principles within the classic stories and texts of India, including the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Puranas. Within the teachings of the ancient Puranic sages and saints such as Valmiki and Vyasa and legendary physicians and mathematician-philosophers such as Aryabhatta and Varahamihir, the author reveals great scientific truths--not those believed by the ancient world, but truths still upheld by modern science, particularly quantum physics. She explores Desha and Kaala (Space and Time), Shankara and his philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, and the Hindu sciences of mathematics, astronomy, and Vedic astrology.  In illustrating the scientific basis of Hinduism and the discoveries of its sages, Vanamali provides a window into the depths of this most ancient spiritual way of life.

A First Course in Partial Differential Equations: with Complex Variables and Transform Methods (Dover Books on Mathematics),H. F. Weinberger,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/40/e0/68/40e068eef8506704a4c9bbaf01344b42.gif,"
                    I got this book after finishing Farlow's Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers. This is a much more mathematically rigorous and sophisticated book, and it took me a lot longer to go through it. (I still haven't done the last two sections on the Laplace transform and approximation methods). My original goal was to learn complex analysis, and since Farlow recommended this book for that topic, I started in the middle with Section VIII, Analytic Functions of a Complex Variable, then did IX and X, then I through VII. This caused a few difficulties solving some of the problems in the later sections due to unfamiliarity with material presented in the earlier sections. E.g. problem 71.4 presumes a knowledge of Green's function, which is covered in section V. Nonetheless, this worked out OK. I now feel as though I have a pretty solid grounding in the material (by which I mean not that I can remember it all, but I can recognize when I've seen it before, and know where to look it up again). That is my operational definition of having ""learned"" the material.  Frankly, I'm quite surprised by the second reviewer's comment that this book would not be good for self-instruction. I thought it was great! But I had to be very patient and resist the urge to move ahead before I really understood what I had just read. Doing the problems is an excellent reality check! That's one of the features of this book that I liked the most: lots of problems, with ALL the answers in the back, so you can't fool yourself. Most of the answers can be reached with persistence, although I was stumped by a few. But don't buy this book if you don't have a background in calculus and ordinary differential equations! It would also be helpful to review the topic of partial differential equations in an easier format, like Farlow, before progressing to this text.  The material is interesting and varied. There are sections heavy on abstract math and proofs of theorems, other sections mostly practical in orientation. The section on complex analysis lives up to its billing in Farlow. In general, I found that I could skim through the really abstract material without losing the thread of the argument. I'm not good at proofs so I skipped over most of the problems that called for proving something. But at least now I know what is meant by existence and uniqueness proofs, etc.  The book has very few errors. I've listed the ones I think are errors below. Maybe they are and maybe they aren't! p. 182 second paragraph R(r) sin(n*theta) etc. should be R(r) sin(m*theta) etc.  p. 192 fifth line from bottom ""degree n in x,y, and z"" should be ""degree n in x,y, and r"". p. 223 second equation from bottom should be du2/de*du1/dx - dv2/de*dv1/dx + i(dv2/de*du1/dx + du2/de*dv1/dx) p. 265 last equation right hand side integrand should be e^(-i*theta), not e^(i*theta).  Solutions to exercises: 1.4: rho subzero du1/dx + d rho subone/dt = 0 5.4: answer can be reduced further to 157/4096, which is how my calculator displayed it 7.5: last line: dA/dt greater than or equal to 0 10.2: second line: epsilon 3 = z*sqrt(alpha/D) 14.1e: e^(-n^2*pi^2*t-t-x)*sin(n*pi*(x-1)) 18.4: right side of equation should be 1/2 (e^pi + e^(-pi)) i.e. cosh(pi) 31.4: one times first sum, not two times first sum, and difference between first sum and second (double) sum, not sum of the two 32.3: second line, numerator, sinh term should be sinh (sqrt((n-1/2)^2 + (2m-1)^2 +1) * (1-z)) 37.1: substituting xbar = x+1 in formula for c sub-n I get c sub-n twice what answer gives.  37.4: formula for c sub-n: integrand should include (1+x)^-1, not ^-2. 44.4: the exponential t-term is e^(-(mu sub-k supra-(n+1/2))*t), not e^(-mu sub-k supra-((n+1/2)*t)) 50.7: log term is log(2 plus or minus sqrt(3)) 53.4: the part of the disk to the LEFT of the line.... 58.2: ? pi*i*(e-2) 58.7: ? -pi/3 Happy self-instructing!

This volume focuses on recent developments in non-linear and hyperbolic equations. In the first contribution, the singularities of the solutions of several classes of non-linear partial differential equations are investigated. Applications concern the Monge-Ampère equation, quasi-linear systems arising in fluid mechanics as well as integro-differential equations for media with memory. There follows an article on L_p-L_q decay estimates for Klein-Gordon equations with time-dependent coefficients, explaining, in particular, the influence of the relation between the mass term and the wave propagation speed. The next paper addresses questions of local existence of solutions, blow-up criteria, and C^8 regularity for quasilinear weakly hyperbolic equations. Spectral theory of semibounded selfadjoint operators is the topic of a further contribution, providing upper and lower bounds for the bottom eigenvalue as well as an upper bound for the second eigenvalue in terms of capacitary estimates.

In Thermal Physics: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics are stated precisely as postulates and subsequently connected to historical context and developed mathematically. These laws are applied systematically to topics such as phase equilibria, chemical reactions, external forces, fluid-fluid surfaces and interfaces, and anisotropic crystal-fluid interfaces. Statistical mechanics is presented in the context of information theory to quantify entropy, followed by development of the most important ensembles: microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical. A unified treatment of ideal classical, Fermi, and Bose gases is presented, including Bose condensation, degenerate Fermi gases, and classical gases with internal structure. Additional topics include paramagnetism, adsorption on dilute sites, point defects in crystals, thermal aspects of intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, density matrix formalism, the Ising model, and an introduction to Monte Carlo simulation.  Throughout the book, problems are posed and solved to illustrate specific results and problem-solving techniques.Includes applications of interest to physicists, physical chemists, and materials scientists, as well as materials, chemical, and mechanical engineersSuitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and practicing researchersDevelops content systematically with increasing order of complexitySelf-contained, including nine appendices to handle necessary background and technical details   ",https://1lib.in/dl/2717455/526ff6,610,Elsevier,2015,english,"PDF, 7.57 MB"

A timely introduction to current research on PID and predictive control by one of the leading authors on the subject PID and Predictive Control of Electric Drives and Power Supplies using MATLAB/Simulink examines the classical control system strategies, such as PID control, feed-forward control and cascade control, which are widely used in current practice.  The authors share their experiences in actual design and implementation of the control systems on laboratory test-beds, taking the reader from the fundamentals through to more sophisticated design and analysis.    The book contains sections on closed-loop performance analysis in both frequency domain and time domain, presented to help the designer in selection of controller parameters and validation of the control system.  Continuous-time model predictive control systems are designed for the drives and power supplies, and operational constraints are imposed in the design.    Discrete-time model predictive control systems are designed based on the discretization of the physical models, which will appeal to readers who are more familiar with sampled-data control system. Soft sensors and observers will be discussed for low cost implementation.  Resonant control of the electric drives and power supply will be discussed to deal with the problems of bias in sensors and unbalanced three phase AC currents.  Brings together both classical control systems and predictive control systems in a logical style from introductory through to advanced levels Demonstrates how simulation and experimental results are used to support theoretical analysis and the proposed design algorithms MATLAB and Simulink tutorials are given in each chapter to show the readers how to take the theory to applications.  Includes MATLAB and Simulink software using xPC Target for teaching purposes A companion website is available  Researchers and industrial engineers; and graduate students on electrical engineering courses will find this a valuable resource.

Dynamics is a science concerned with movement and changes. In the most general approach it relates to life processes as well as behavior in nature in rest. It governs small particles, technical objects, conversion of matter and materials but also concerns people, groups of people in their individual and, in particular, social dimension. In dynamics we always have to do with causes or stimuli for motion, the rules of reaction or behavior and its result in the form of trajectory of changes.This book is devoted to dynamics of a wide class of specific but very important objects such as electromechanical systems. This is a very rigorous discipline and has a long tradition, as its theoretical bases were formulated in the first half of the XIX century by d’ Alembert, Lagrange, Hamilton, Maxwell and other prominent scientists, but their crucial results were based on previous pioneering research of others such as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton…This book in its theoretical foundations is based on the principle of least action which governs classical as well as relativistic mechanics and electromagnetism and leads to Lagrange’s equations which are applied in the book as universal method to construct equations of motion of electromechanical systems. It gives common and coherent grounds to formulate mathematical models for all lumped parameters’ electromechanical systems, which are vital in our contemporary industry and civilized everyday life.From these remarks it seems that the book is general and theoretical but in fact it is a very practical one concerning modern electrical drives in a broad sense, including electromechanical energy conversion, induction motor drives, brushless DC drives with a permanent magnet excitation and switched reluctance machines (SRM). And of course their control, which means shaping of their trajectories of motion using modern tools, their designed autonomy in keeping a track according to our programmed expectations.The problems presented in the book are widely illustrated by characteristics, trajectories, dynamic courses all computed by use of developed simulation models throughout the book. There are some classical subjects and the history of the discipline is discussed but finally all modern tools and means are presented and applied.More detailed descriptions follow in abstracts for the particular chapters.The author hopes kind readers will enjoy and profit from reading this book.

The concept of moving machine members during a thermodynamic cycle and the variation ofdisplacements, velocities and accelerations forms the subject of kinematics.The study of forces that make the motion is the subject of kinetics; combining these two subjects leads to dynamics of machinery. When we include the machinery aspects such as links, kinematic chains, and mechanisms to form a given machine we have the subject of Theory of Machines. Usually this subject is introduced as a two-semester course, where kinematics and kinetics are taught simultaneously withthermodynamics or heat engines before progressing to the design of machine members. This book provides the material for first semester of a Theory of Machines- course.Th is book brings in the machine live onto the screen and explains the theory of machines concepts through animations and introduces how the problems are solved in industry to present a complete history in the shortest possible time rather than using graphical (or analytical) methods. Thus the students are introduced to the concepts through visual means which brings industrial applications by the end of the two semester program closer, and equips them better for design courses. The International Federation for promotion of Mechanism and Machine Science (IFToMM) has developed standardnomenclature and notation on Mechanism and Machine Science and this book adopts these standards so that any communication between scientists and in the classrooms across the world can make use of the same terminology. This book adopts HyperWorks MotionSolve to perform the analysis and visualizations, though the book can be used independent of the requirement of any particular software. However, having this software helps in further studies and analysis.

                    For many years, various editions of Smallman's Modern Physical Metallurgy have served throughout the world as a standard undergraduate textbook on metals and alloys. In 1995, it was rewritten and enlarged to encompass the related subject of materials science and engineering and appeared under the title Metals & Materials: Science, Processes, Applications offering a comprehensive amount of a much wider range of engineering materials. Coverage ranged from pure elements to superalloys, from glasses to engineering ceramics, and from everyday plastics to in situ composites, Amongst other favourable reviews, Professor Bhadeshia of Cambridge University commented: ""Given the amount of work that has obviously gone into this book and its extensive comments, it is very attractively priced. It is an excellent book to be recommend strongly for purchase by undergraduates in materials-related subjects, who should benefit greatly by owning a text containing so much knowledge.The book now includes new chapters on materials for sports equipment (golf, tennis, bicycles, skiing, etc.) and biomaterials (replacement joints, heart valves, tissue repair, etc.) - two of the most exciting and rewarding areas in current materials research and development. As in its predecessor, numerous examples are given of the ways in which knowledge of the relation between fine structure and properties has made it possible to optimise the service behaviour of traditional engineering materials and to develop completely new and exciting classes of materials. Special consideration is given to the crucial processing stage that enables materials to be produced as marketable commodities. Whilst attempting to produce a useful and relatively concise survey of key materials and their interrelationships, the authors have tried to make the subject accessible to a wide range of readers, to provide insights into specialised methods of examination and to convey the excitement of the atmosphere in which new materials are conceived and developed.

                    Thermal Power Plant Control and Instrumentation describes the systems and equipment used for measuring and controlling boilers and heat-recovery steam-generators used in land and marine power plant and in process industries. It provides a practical guide to the design, installation, operation and maintenance of these systems. Starting with descriptions of how each area of the plant operates, it shows how the relevant control systems have evolved, how they are implemented in modern systems and how to evaluate the merits of alternative approaches. The rise of renewable power in the generation mix, and of biomass in the fuel, has demanded greater flexibility from combustion plants, requiring more sophisticated and robust control. In parallel, thermal power plants have been developed with overfire air systems to reduce NOx, once-through supercritical boilers to increase efficiency and model-based control schemes to optimise response. These developments have brought opportunities in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency and safety, but also the risk of a comprehension gap between control specialists and power plant engineers, a gap this new edition aims to bridge.

                    Metrology is the science of measurements. It is traceable to measurement standards, thus to the concept of measurement accuracy, which is used in all natural and technical sciences, as well as in some fields of social sciences and liberal arts. The key problem is one of obtaining knowledge of the physical reality, which is observed through a prism of an assemblage of quantity properties describing the objectively-real world. One of the fundamental tasks of metrology is the development of theoretical and methodological aspects of the procedure of getting an accurate knowledge relating to objects and processes of the surrounding world. Due to the rapid development of information technologies and intelligent measurement systems and measuring instruments, as well as to the growing usage of mathematical methods in social and biological sciences, this monograph is dedicated to convey the fundamental theory.

                    The International System of Units (SI) is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used every day in commerce and science, and is the modern form of the metric system. It currently comprises the meter (m), the kilogram (kg), the second (s), the ampere (A), the kelvin (K), the candela (cd) and the mole (mol)). The system is changing though, units and unit definitions are modified through international agreements as the technology of measurement progresses, and as the precision of measurements improves. The SI is now being redefined based on constants of nature and their realization by quantum standards. Therefore, the underlying physics and technologies will receive increasing interest, and not only in the metrology community but in all fields of science. This book introduces and explains the applications of modern physics concepts to metrology, the science and the applications of measurements. A special focus is made on the use of quantum standards for the realization of the forthcoming new SI (the international system of units). The basic physical phenomena are introduced on a level which provides comprehensive information for the experienced reader but also provides a guide for a more intense study of these phenomena for students.

How can the vibration be reduced? Which sorts of rotor vibration are the worst? The book develops this understanding initially using extremely simple models for each phenomenon, in which (at most) four equations capture the behavior. More detailed models are then developed based on finite element analysis, to enable the accurate simulation of the relevant phenomena for real machines. Analysis software (in MATLAB) is associated with this book, and novices to rotordynamics can expect to make good predictions of critical speeds and rotating mode shapes within days.

                    The study of the kinematics and dynamics of machines lies at the very core of a mechanical engineering background. Although tremendous advances have been made in the computational and design tools now available, little has changed in the way the subject is presented, both in the classroom and in professional references.Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms brings the subject alive and current. The author's careful integration of Mathematica software gives readers a chance to perform symbolic analysis, to plot the results, and most importantly, to animate the motion. They get to ""play"" with the mechanism parameters and immediately see their effects. A CD-ROM packaged with the book contains Mathematica-based programs for suggested design projects.As useful as Mathematica is, however, a tool should not interfere with but enhance one's grasp of the concepts and the development of analytical skills.

The book deals with accurate modeling of electric machines during transient and steady states, a topic which has been usually avoided in the literature. The modeling techniques herein take into account all machine peculiarities, such as the type and connection of its windings, slotting, and saturation in the iron core. A special emphasis in the book is given to the exact physical interpretation of all phenomena which influence the machine's transient behavior. Besides the Introduction, the book has five chapters. The second chapter describes basic concepts of the magnetic equivalent circuit theory and has examples of magnetic equivalent circuits of several types of machines with their node potential equations. In the third chapter the transform matrices w' and w"" of A.C. wind­ ings are derived. These matrices playa very important role in the magnetic equivalent circuit theory because they connect the quantities from the ma­ chine's magnetic equivalent circuit, branch fluxes, and mmfs with the ma­ chine's phase currents and fluxes.

Basic models and concepts of machine dynamics and motion control are presented in the order of the principal steps of machine design. The machine is treated as a coupled dynamical system, including drive, mechanisms and controller, to reveal its behavior at different regimes through the interaction of its units under dynamic and processing loads. The main dynamic effects in machines are explained. The influence of component compliances on accuracy, stability and efficiency of the machines is analyzed. Methods for decreasing internal and external vibration activity of machines are described. The dynamic features of digital control are considered. Special attention is given to machines with intense dynamic behavior: resonant and hand-held percussion ones. Targeted to engineers as well as to lecturers and advanced students.

Dynamic Thermal Analysis of Machines in Running State,Lihui Wang (auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/6f/34/ed/6f34ed69509629bd7db0495172df447c.jpg,"
With the increasing complexity and dynamism in today’s machine design and development, more precise, robust and practical approaches and systems are needed to support machine design. Existing design methods treat the targeted machine as stationery. Analysis and simulation are mostly performed at the component level. Although there are some computer-aided engineering tools capable of motion analysis and vibration simulation etc., the machine itself is in the dry-run state. For effective machine design, understanding its thermal behaviours is crucial in achieving the desired performance in real situation.Dynamic Thermal Analysis of Machines in Running State presents a set of innovative solutions to dynamic thermal analysis of machines when they are put under actual working conditions. The objective is to better understand the thermal behaviours of a machine in real situation while at the design stage. The book has two major sections, with the first section presenting a broad-based review of the key areas of research in dynamic thermal analysis and simulation, and the second section presents an in-depth treatment of relevant methodology and algorithms, leading to better understanding of a machine in real situation.The book is a collection of novel ideas, taking into account the need for presenting intellectual challenges while appealing to a broad readership, including academic researchers, practicing engineers and managers, and graduate students. Given the essential role of modern machines in factory automation and quality assurance, a book dedicated to the topic of dynamic thermal analysis, and its practical applications to machine design would be beneficial to readers of all design and manufacturing sectors, from machine design to automotive engineering, in better understanding the present challenges and solutions, as well as future research directions in this important area.

This book, intended for people in engineering and fundamental sciences, presents an integrated mathematical methodology for advanced dynamics and control of structures and machines, ranging from the derivation of models up to the control synthesis problem. This point of view is particularly useful as the physical insight and the associated structural properties, related e.g. to the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian framework, can be advantageously utilized. To this end, up to date results in disciplines like continuum mechanics, analytical mechanics, thermodynamics and electrodynamics are presented exploiting the differential geometric properties, with the basic notions of this coordinate-free approach revisited in an own chapter. In order to illustrate the proposed methodologies, several industrial applications, e.g., the derivation of exact solutions for the deformation compensation by shaped actuation in elastic bodies, or the coordination of rigid and flexible joint robots, are discussed.

Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms,Oleg Vinogradov,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/cb/da/d2/cbdad2d423676eb29a8366a356f9537e.jpg,"
                    The study of the kinematics and dynamics of machines lies at the very core of a mechanical engineering background. Although tremendous advances have been made in the computational and design tools now available, little has changed in the way the subject is presented, both in the classroom and in professional references.

Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms brings the subject alive and current. The author's careful integration of Mathematica software gives readers a chance to perform symbolic analysis, to plot the results, and most importantly, to animate the motion. They get to ""play"" with the mechanism parameters and immediately see their effects. A CD-ROM packaged with the book contains Mathematica-based programs for suggested design projects.

As useful as Mathematica is, however, a tool should not interfere with but enhance one's grasp of the concepts and the development of analytical skills. The author ensures this with his emphasis on the understanding and application of basic theoretical principles, unified approach to the analysis of planar mechanisms, and introduction to vibrations and rotordynamics.

                    This broad-based book covers the three major areas of Chemical Engineering. Most of the books in the market involve one of the individual areas, namely, Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer or Mass Transfer, rather than all the three. This book presents this material in a single source. This avoids the user having to refer to a number of books to obtain information. Most published books covering all the three areas in a single source emphasize theory rather than practical issues. This book is written with emphasis on practice with brief theoretical concepts in the form of questions and answers, not adopting stereo-typed question-answer approach practiced in certain books in the market, bridging the two areas of theory and practice with respect to the core areas of chemical engineering. Most parts of the book are easily understandable by those who are not experts in the field. Fluid Mechanics chapters include basics on non-Newtonian systems which, for instance find importance in polymer and food processing, flow through piping, flow measurement, pumps, mixing technology and fluidization and two phase flow. For example it covers types of pumps and valves, membranes and areas of their use, different equipment commonly used in chemical industry and their merits and drawbacks. Heat Transfer chapters cover the basics involved in conduction, convection and radiation, with emphasis on insulation, heat exchangers, evaporators, condensers, reboilers and fired heaters. Design methods, performance, operational issues and maintenance problems are highlighted. Topics such as heat pipes, heat pumps, heat tracing, steam traps, refrigeration, cooling of electronic devices, NOx control find place in the book. Mass transfer chapters cover basics such as diffusion, theories, analogies, mass transfer coefficients and mass transfer with chemical reaction, equipment such as tray and packed columns, column internals including structural packings, design, operational and installation issues, drums and separators are discussed in good detail. Absorption, distillation, extraction and leaching with applications and design methods, including emerging practices involving Divided Wall and Petluk column arrangements, multicomponent separations, supercritical solvent extraction find place in the book.

                    Most of the equations governing the problems related to science and engineering are nonlinear in nature. As a result, they are inherently difficult to solve. Analytical solutions are available only for some special cases. For other cases, one has no easy means but to solve the problem must depend on numerical solutions. Fluid Flow, Heat and Mass Transfer at Bodies of Different Shapes: Numerical Solutions presents the current theoretical developments of boundary layer theory, a branch of transport phenomena. Also, the book addresses the theoretical developments in the area and presents a number of physical problems that have been solved by analytical or numerical method. It is focused particularly on fluid flow problems governed by nonlinear differential equations. The book is intended for researchers in applied mathematics, physics, mechanics and engineering.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2701758/62b306,193,Academic Press,2015,english,"PDF, 4.67 MB"

Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis: Linear Finite Element Analysis,Ioannis Koutromanos,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/27/ba/e0/27bae0688808f9f0705d08df27463e7d.jpg,"
An introductory textbook covering the fundamentals of linear finite element analysis (FEA)  This book constitutes the first volume in a two-volume set that introduces readers to the theoretical foundations and the implementation of the finite element method (FEM). The first volume focuses on the use of the method for linear problems. A general procedure is presented for the finite element analysis (FEA) of a physical problem, where the goal is to specify the values of a field function. First, the strong form of the problem (governing differential equations and boundary conditions) is formulated. Subsequently, a weak form of the governing equations is established. Finally, a finite element approximation is introduced, transforming the weak form into a system of equations where the only unknowns are nodal values of the field function. The procedure is applied to one-dimensional elasticity and heat conduction, multi-dimensional steady-state scalar field problems (heat conduction, chemical diffusion, flow in porous media), multi-dimensional elasticity and structural mechanics (beams/shells), as well as time-dependent (dynamic) scalar field problems, elastodynamics and structural dynamics. Important concepts for finite element computations, such as isoparametric elements for multi-dimensional analysis and Gaussian quadrature for numerical evaluation of integrals, are presented and explained. Practical aspects of FEA and advanced topics, such as reduced integration procedures, mixed finite elements and verification and validation of the FEM are also discussed.   Provides detailed derivations of finite element equations for a variety of problems. Incorporates quantitative examples on one-dimensional and multi-dimensional FEA. Provides an overview of multi-dimensional linear elasticity (definition of stress and strain tensors, coordinate transformation rules, stress-strain relation and material symmetry) before presenting the pertinent FEA procedures. Discusses practical and advanced aspects of FEA, such as treatment of constraints, locking, reduced integration, hourglass control, and multi-field (mixed) formulations. Includes chapters on transient (step-by-step) solution schemes for time-dependent scalar field problems and elastodynamics/structural dynamics. Contains a chapter dedicated to verification and validation for the FEM and another chapter dedicated to solution of linear systems of equations and to introductory notions of parallel computing. Includes appendices with a review of matrix algebra and overview of matrix analysis of discrete systems.   Accompanied by a website hosting an open-source finite element program for linear elasticity and heat conduction, together with a user tutorial.  Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis: Linear Finite Element Analysis is an ideal text for undergraduate and graduate students in civil, aerospace and mechanical engineering, finite element software vendors, as well as practicing engineers and anybody with an interest in linear finite element analysis.

Based on one of the best-known textbooks on finite element analysis of composite materials, it reflects the state of the art in modeling.

The analysis of composites treated in this textbook includes the analysis of the material itself, at the micro-level, and the analysis of structures made of composite materials. This textbook evolved from the class notes of MAE 646 Advanced Mechanics of Composite Materials that I teach as a graduate course at West Virginia University. Although this is also a textbook on advanced mechanics of composite materials, the use of the finite element method is essential for the solution of the complex boundary value problems encountered in the advanced analysis of composites, and thus the title of the book. There are a number of good textbooks on advanced mechanics of composite materials, but none carries the theory to a practical level by actually solving problems, as it is done in this textbook. Some books devoted exclusively to finite element analysis include some examples about modeling composites but fall quite short of dealing with the actual analysis and design issues of composite materials and composite structures. This textbook includes an explanation of the concepts involved in the detailed analysis of composites, a sound explanation of the mechanics needed to translate those concepts into a mathematical representation of the physical reality, and a detailed explanation of the solution of the resulting boundary value problems by using commercial Finite Element Analysis software such as AbaqusTM. Furthermore, this textbook includes more than fifty fully developed examples interspersed with the theory, as well as more than seventy-five exercises at the end of chapters, and more than fifty separate pieces of Abaqus""--  Read more...

This book gives Abaqus users who make use of finite-element models in academic or practitioner-based research the in-depth program knowledge that allows them to debug a structural analysis model. The book provides many methods and guidelines for different analysis types and modes, that will help readers to solve problems that can arise with Abaqus if a structural model fails to converge to a solution. The use of Abaqus affords a general checklist approach to debugging analysis models, which can also be applied to structural analysis.The author uses step-by-step methods and detailed explanations of special features in order to identify the solutions to a variety of problems with finite-element models. The book promotes: • a diagnostic mode of thinking concerning error messages; • better material definition and the writing of user material subroutines; • work with the Abaqus mesher and best practice in doing so; • the writing of user element subroutines and contact features with convergence issues; and• consideration of hardware and software issues and a Windows HPC cluster solution.The methods and information provided facilitate job diagnostics and help to obtain converged solutions for finite-element models regarding structural component assemblies in static or dynamic analysis. The troubleshooting advice ensures that these solutions are both high-quality and cost-effective according to practical experience. The book offers an in-depth guide for students learning about Abaqus, as each problem and solution are complemented by examples and straightforward explanations. It is also useful for academics and structural engineers wishing to debug Abaqus models on the basis of error and warning messages that arise during finite-element modelling processing.

                    Thermal Power Plant Control and Instrumentation describes the systems and equipment used for measuring and controlling boilers and heat-recovery steam-generators used in land and marine power plant and in process industries. It provides a practical guide to the design, installation, operation and maintenance of these systems. Starting with descriptions of how each area of the plant operates, it shows how the relevant control systems have evolved, how they are implemented in modern systems and how to evaluate the merits of alternative approaches. The rise of renewable power in the generation mix, and of biomass in the fuel, has demanded greater flexibility from combustion plants, requiring more sophisticated and robust control. In parallel, thermal power plants have been developed with overfire air systems to reduce NOx, once-through supercritical boilers to increase efficiency and model-based control schemes to optimise response. These developments have brought opportunities in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency and safety, but also the risk of a comprehension gap between control specialists and power plant engineers, a gap this new edition aims to bridge.
