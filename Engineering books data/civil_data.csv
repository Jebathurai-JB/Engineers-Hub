                    Water Chemistry provides students with the tools necessary to understand the processes that control the chemical species present in waters of both natural and engineered systems. After providing basic information about water itself and the chemical composition of water in environmental systems, the text covers the necessary theory (thermodynamics, activity, and kinetics) and background material to solve problems. It emphasizes that both equilibrium and kinetic processes are important in aquatic systems. The book does not merely focus on inorganic constituents, but also on the fate and reactions of organic chemicals.The solving of quantitative equilibrium and kinetic problems using mathematical, graphical, and computational tools is emphasized throughout presentations on acid-base chemistry, complexation of metal ions, solubility of minerals, and oxidation-reduction reactions. The use of these problem-solving tools is then extended in the presentation of topics relevant to natural systems, including dissolved oxygen, nutrient chemistry, geochemical controls on chemical composition, photochemistry, and natural organic matter. The kinetics and equilibria relevant to engineered systems (e.g., chlorination and disinfection chemistry, sorption and surface chemistry) and organic contaminant chemistry are also discussed. Numerous in-chapter examples that show the application of theory and demonstrate how problems are solved using algebraic, graphical, and computer-based techniques are included. Examples are relevant to both natural waters and engineered systems.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/1161974/a4e0fe,809,"Oxford University Press, USA",2011,english,"PDF, 4.63 MB"

                    Learn physics, engineering, and geology concepts usually seen in high school and college in an easy, accessible style.
This second volume addresses these topics for advanced science fair participants or those who just like reading about and understanding science. 3D Printed Science Project Volume 2 describes eight open-source 3D printable models, as well as creative activities using the resulting 3D printed pieces. The files are designed to print as easily as possible, and the authors give tips for printing them on open source printers.
As 3D printers become more and more common and affordable, hobbyists, teachers, parents, and students stall out once they've printed some toys and a few household items. To get beyond this, most people benefit from a “starter set” of objects as a beginning point in their explorations, partially just to see what is possible. This book tells you the solid science stories that these models offer, and provides them in open-source repositories.

What You Will Learn
• Create (and present the science behind) 3D printed models
• Review innovative ideas for tactile ways to learn concepts in engineering, geology and physics
• Learn what makes a models easy or hard to 3D print

Who This Book Is For

                    The first edition of Rock Mechanics and Engineering bridged the gap between scientific research on rock mechanics and practical engineering. It was resolutely aimed at giving practical information to geologists, engineering geologists and engineers. Emphasis was placed on the lessons to be learnt from the study of case histories, with the Malpasset Dam rupture and the large Vajont rock slide amongst those described. In this second, enlarged edition the author continues to emphasise aspects of rock mechanics. Modern efforts at establishing an engineering classification of rocks are summarised and considerable attention is given to the Austrian tunnelling method. Firm in his belief that there is no better way to study the subject than by the detailed analysis of case histories, Dr Jaeger has incorporated a number of new ones, for example the discussion on the engineering classification of jointed rock masses and the required rock support is illustrated by descriptions of the second Gotthard Tunnel and the design of the third, much larger tunnel.

                    This book is written to explain the influence ground conditions can have upon engineering with rocks and soils, and upon designing, analysing and executing an engineered response to the geological and geomorphological processes acting on them; these subjects form the essence of Engineering Geology. The text is written for students of the subject, either geologists or engineers, who encounter the challenge of idealising the ground and its processes for the purposes of design and of quantifying them for the purpose of analysis. With this in mind the book describes how geology can dictate the design of ground investigations, influence the interpretation of its findings, and be incorporated into design and analysis. The reader is constantly reminded of basic geology; the ""simple"" things that constitute the ""big picture"", a neglect of which may cause design and analyses to be at fault, and construction not to function as it should.

                    Geologic hazards pose the greatest threat to human safety for any geotechnical undertaking, but it is ultimately the engineer's ability to recognize and cope with these hazards that will determine the safety of life and property. Armed with Geologic Hazards: A Field Guide for Geotechnical Engineers you will be able to properly recognize, understand various geologic hazards, and provide safe and economical construction. Eminent expert Roy E. Hunt thoroughly examines the potential for slope failures, earthquakes, ground subsidence, collapse, and expansion. Using a clear conceptual approach, he explains what measures are available to minimize or eliminate the risks associated with each of these geologic hazards.
The book sets forth the basis for recognizing, understanding, and treating geologic hazards, using general concepts rather than rigorous mathematical analyses. The author covers the prediction of slope failures through recognition of geologic and other factors that govern failure, the treatment of slopes that are potentially unstable and pose a danger to some existing development, the design and construction of stable cut slopes and sidehill fills, and the stabilization of failed slopes. He provides the foundation for determining the potential for surface movements and for preventing or controlling their effects. A section on earthquakes summarizes and links all of the aspects of earthquakes including their causes, characteristics, and surface effects. It provides a thorough grounding in how to recognize hazard potential and minimize the consequences.

                    Strength of Materials provides a comprehensive overview of the latest theory of strength of materials. The unified theory presented in this book is developed around three concepts: Hooke's Law, Equilibrium Equations, and Compatibility conditions. The first two of these methods have been fully understood, but clearly are indirect methods with limitations. Through research, the authors have come to understand compatibility conditions, which, until now, had remained in an immature state of development. This method, the Integrated Force Method (IFM) couples equilibrium and compatibility conditions to determine forces directly.   The combination of these methods allows engineering students from a variety of disciplines to comprehend and compare the attributes of each. The concept that IFM strength of materials theory is problem independent, and can be easily generalized for solving difficult problems in linear, nonlinear, and dynamic regimes is focused upon. Discussion of the theory is limited to simple linear analysis problems suitable for an undergraduate course in strength of materials. To support the teaching application of the book there are problems and an instructor's manual.

                    One of the most important subjects for any student of engineering or materials to master is the behaviour of materials and structures under load.  The way in which they react to applied forces, the deflections resulting and the stresses and strains set up in the bodies concerned are all vital considerations when designing a mechanical component such that it will not fail under predicted load during its service lifetime.  Building upon the fundamentals established in the introductory volume Mechanics of Materials 1, this book extends the scope of  material covered into more complex areas such as unsymmetrical bending, loading and deflection of struts, rings, discs, cylinders plates, diaphragms and thin walled sections.  There is a new treatment of the Finite Element Method of analysis, and more advanced topics such as contact and residual stresses, stress concentrations, fatigue, creep and fracture are also covered.  Each chapter contains a summary of the essential formulae which are developed in the chapter, and a large number of worked examples which progress in level of difficulty as the principles are enlarged upon.

                    One of the most important subjects for any student of engineering to master is the behaviour of materials and structures under load.  The way in which they react to applied forces, the deflections resulting and the stresses and strains set up in the bodies concerned are all vital considerations when designing a mechanical component such that it will not fail under predicted load during its service lifetime.  All the essential elements of a treatment of these topics are contained within this course of study, starting with an introduction to the concepts of stress and strain, shear force and bending moments and moving on to the examination of bending, shear and torsion in elements such as beams, cylinders, shells and springs.  A simple treatment of complex stress and complex strain leads to a study of the theories of elastic failure and an introduction to the experimental methods of stress and strain analysis.More advanced topics are dealt with in a companion volume - Mechanics of Materials 2.  Each chapter contains a summary of the essential formulae which are developed in the chapter, and a large number of worked examples which progress in level of difficulty as the principles are enlarged upon.  In addition, each chapter concludes with an extensive selection of problems for solution by the student, mostly examination questions from professional and academic bodies, which are graded according to difficulty and furnished with answers at the end.                                       * Emphasis on practical learning and applications, rather than theory* Provides the essential formulae for each individual chapter* Contains numerous worked examples and problems                ",https://1lib.in/dl/896461/2b36c4,450,Unknown,1997,english,"PDF, 18.23 MB"

                    Christians sometimes approach the Old Testament with a mixture of awe and bewilderment, knowing that it contains pearls of wisdom, but unsure how to dive for them ... especially when it comes to the Prophets.In The Message of the Prophets, author J. Daniel Hays offers a scholarly, yet readable and student-friendly survey of the Old Testament prophetic literature that presents the message of each prophet in its historical and its biblical context and then tracks that message through the New Testament to challenge readers with what it means for them today. Hays focuses on synthesizing the message of the prophets, which enables students to grasp the major contours of the prophetic books clearly and concisely. Hundreds of colorful pictures help to illustrate the historical and cultural background of the prophets. After identifying what the message meant for ancient Israel, Hays helps the readers to move toward theological application today, helping readers to gain a better understanding of God and the relationship between God and his people. The Message of the Prophets is essential for professors, students, and others seeking to understand the role that the OT prophets play in the Christian faith.

                    A new edition of this classic work, comprehensively revised to present exciting new developments in this important subject

The study of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations is constantly developing and regenerating, and this third edition of a popular classic volume, written by one of the world’s leading experts in the field, presents an account of the subject which reflects both its historical and well-established place in computational science and its vital role as a cornerstone of modern applied mathematics.

In addition to serving as a broad and comprehensive study of numerical methods for initial value problems, this book contains a special emphasis on Runge-Kutta methods by the mathematician who transformed the subject into its modern form dating from his classic 1963 and 1972 papers.  A second feature is general linear methods which have now matured and grown from being a framework for a unified theory of a wide range of diverse numerical schemes to a source of new and practical algorithms in their own right.  As the founder of general linear method research, John Butcher has been a leading contributor to its development; his special role is reflected in the text.  The book is written in the lucid style characteristic of the author, and combines enlightening explanations with rigorous and precise analysis. In addition to these anticipated features, the book breaks new ground by including the latest results on the highly efficient G-symplectic methods which compete strongly with the well-known symplectic Runge-Kutta methods for long-term integration of conservative mechanical systems.

Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations: Finite Difference and Finite Volume Methods focuses on two popular deterministic methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), namely finite difference and finite volume methods. The solution of PDEs can be very challenging, depending on the type of equation, the number of independent variables, the boundary, and initial conditions, and other factors. These two methods have been traditionally used to solve problems involving fluid flow.  For practical reasons, the finite element method, used more often for solving problems in solid mechanics, and covered extensively in various other texts, has been excluded. The book is intended for beginning graduate students and early career professionals, although advanced undergraduate students may find it equally useful.  The material is meant to serve as a prerequisite for students who might go on to take additional courses in computational mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, or computational electromagnetics.

As complete and authoritative as any volume on the subject, it discusses soil formation, index properties, and classification; soil permeability, seepage, and the effect of water on stress conditions; stresses due to surface loads; soil compressibility and consolidation; and shear strength characteristics of soils.   While this book is a valuable teaching text for advanced students, it is one that the practicing engineer will continually be taking off the shelf long after school lets out. Just the quick reference it affords to a huge range of tests and the appendices filled with essential data, makes it an essential addition to an civil engineering library.

                    Accelerating economic development and urbanization has led to engineers becoming increasingly ambitious, carrying out excavations in more difficult soils, so that excavations are deeper and more extensive. These complex conditions require advanced analysis, design methods and construction technologies. Most books on general foundation engineering introduce basic analysis and design of excavation, but do not usually deal with analysis and design in practice. This book covers both areas, introducing methods currently used in modern engineering, which can readily be applied to analysis and design in actual excavations. Based on interaction between research results, analysis and teaching experience, the book is suitable for both teachers and engineers in advanced analysis and design.

What data is required to gauge compliance and performance? How can construction issues and problems quickly be identified, rectified, and not repeated? And as construction works proceeds, what is required to ensure performance is maintained whilst achieving specified quality standards safely and with minimal environmental harm?In answering these questions, this book establishes the role of the construction supervisor, applicable to both the consultant and contractor, as it details how construction should be monitored and verified, and how quality, scope, time, and cost aspects can be effectively managed. As construction supervision is employed to its full potential, it becomes a powerful tool that can ensure that the desired construction performance and later operational performance are achieved. Construction supervision, after all, is key to attaining quality control, safety, and environmental compliance as it ensures that the required and specified things are done as required, first time. In writing this book, the authors have drawn much on their extensive and worldwide in-practice experience to articulate how construction supervision should be conducted, outlining what site information should be captured and how it can be used to assess and influence overall work performance.

                    Tensile surface structures are the visual expression of an intensive rethinking of the topic of building envelopes by designers. Advances in design methods, materials, construction elements and assembly and erection planning in the field of lightweight construction are enabling ever more exacting applications of tensile structures with envelope and structural functions, especially in roofing over large clear spans without internal support.     However, the particular mechanical characteristics of the materials used in the construction of textile structures demand consideration of the question of ""buildability"". This book provides answers by discussing the fundamental influence of material manufacture and assembly in deciding the most suitable type of building or structure and its detailing in the design process.     The fundamentals of material composition, manufacturing process, patterning and the behaviour of flexible structural systems are all explained here, as well as their use as structural and connection elements, and special attention is given to the erection of wide-span lightweight structures. The erection equipment is described, as well as the lifting and tensioning process and the construction methods used to erect the characteristic types of tensile structures, illustrated with a selection of example projects.

From the New Science of Vico in the 18th century, through to Marxist writers, ethnomethodologists and Wittgenstein, ideas as to how socio-cultural processes provide the resources that make us human are traced to the present day. Despite constructionists often being criticised as 'relativists', 'activists' and 'anti-establishment' and for making no concrete contributions, their ideas are now being adopted by practically-oriented disciplines such as management consultancy, advertising, therapy, education and nursing.

FRP Composites for Reinforced and Prestressed Concrete Structures: a guide to fundamentals and design for repair and retrofit (Structural Engineering: Mechanics and Design),Peruma Balaguru,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/a5/80/51/a58051e3f86d9cc80485d6ca8b0ba58f.jpg,"
                    High strength fibre composites (FRPs) have been used with civil structures since the 1980s, mostly in the repair, strengthening and retrofitting of concrete structures. This has attracted considerable research, and the industry has expanded exponentially in the last decade. Design guidelines have been developed by professional organizations in a number of countries including USA, Japan, Europe and China, but until now designers have had no publication which provides practical guidance or accessible coverage of the fundamentals.     This book fills this void. It deals with the fundamentals of composites, and basic design principles, and provides step-by-step guidelines for design. Its main theme is the repair and retrofit of un-reinforced, reinforced and prestressed concrete structures using carbon, glass and other high strength fibre composites. In the case of beams, the focus is on their strengthening for flexure and shear or their stiffening. The main interest with columns is the improvement of their ductility; and both strengthening and ductility improvement of un-reinforced structures are covered. Methods for evaluating the strengthened structures are presented. Step by step procedures are set out, including flow charts, for the various structural components, and design examples and practice problems are used to illustrate.    As infrastructure ages worldwide, and its demolition and replacement becomes less of an option, the need for repair and retrofit of existing facilities will increase. Besides its audience of design professionals, this book suits graduate and advanced undergraduate students.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/938912/03239c,336,Unknown,2008,english,"PDF, 7.51 MB"

Building for Eternity: The History and Technology of Roman Concrete Engineering in the Sea,C.J. Brandon,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/01/fc/e9/01fce9b581454fc57b8f3218066647c2.jpg,"
                    One marker of the majesty of ancient Rome is its surviving architectural legacy, the stunning remains of which are scattered throughout the circum-Mediterranean landscape. Surprisingly, one truly remarkable aspect of this heritage remains relatively unknown. There exists beneath the waters of the Mediterranean the physical remnants of a vast maritime infrastructure that sustained and connected the western world's first global empire and economy. The key to this incredible accomplishment and to the survival of structures in the hostile environment of the sea for two thousand years was maritime concrete, a building material invented and then employed by Roman builders on a grand scale to construct harbor installations anywhere they were needed, rather than only in locations with advantageous geography or topography.  This book explains how the Romans built so successfully in the sea with their new invention. The story is a stimulating mix of archaeological, geological, historical and chemical research, with relevance to both ancient and modern technology. It also breaks new ground in bridging the gap between science and the humanities by integrating analytical materials science, history, and archaeology, along with underwater exploration. The book will be of interest to anyone interested in Roman architecture and engineering, and it will hold special interest for geologists and mineralogists studying the material characteristics of pyroclastic volcanic rocks and their alteration in seawater brines. The demonstrable durability and longevity of Roman maritime concrete structures may be of special interest to engineers working on cementing materials appropriate for the long-term storage of hazardous substances such as radioactive waste.  A pioneering methodology was used to bore into maritime structures both on land and in the sea to collect concrete cores for testing in the research laboratories of the CTG Italcementi Group, a leading cement producer in Italy, the University of Berkeley, and elsewhere. The resulting mechanical, chemical and physical analysis of 36 concrete samples taken from 11 sites in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean have helped fill many gaps in our knowledge of how the Romans built in the sea. To gain even more knowledge of the ancient maritime technology, the directors of the Roman Maritime Concrete Study (ROMACONS) engaged in an ambitious and unique experimental archaeological project - the construction underwater of a reproduction of a Roman concrete pier or pila. The same raw materials and tools available to the ancient builders were employed to produce a reproduction concrete structure that appears to be remarkably similar to the ancient one studied during ROMACON's fieldwork between 2002-2009.  This volume reveals a remarkable and unique archaeological project that highlights the synergy that now exists between the humanities and science in our continuing efforts to understand the past. It will quickly become a standard research tool for all interested in Roman building both in the sea and on land, and in the history and chemistry of marine concrete. The authors also hope that the data and observations it presents will stimulate further research by scholars and students into related topics, since we have so much more to learn in the years ahead.

                    Durability failures in reinforced concrete structures are wasteful of resources and energy. The introduction to practice of European Standard EN 206-1 represents a significant shift in emphasis on the need to explicitly consider each potential durability threat when specifying and producing concrete. Fundamentals of Durable Reinforced Concrete presents the fundamental aspects of concrete durability including reinforcement corrosion, carbonation, chloride ingress, alkali-aggregate reaction, freeze/thaw damage, sulphate attack, chemical attack, cracking, abrasion and weathering. The background to the durability exposure classes in EN 206-1 is also explained. Future directions in performance-based specifications and mathematical modelling of degradation are presented. This book will be of particular interest to specifiers applying the principles of the new European Standard EN 206-1 for the first time, to postgraduate researchers in mathematical modelling of degradation mechanisms, to undergraduates of engineering, architecture and building technology, and students of advanced concrete technology who require a concise source of reference on concrete durability.

It is, however, a thoroughly modern language, and has strongly influenced the design of other modern languages like ML and Python.The book starts in Scheme, then adds object oriented techniques and assembly language. It finishes with a transition to Java, which is, of course, similar to C++. This approach will provide a much broader background than a typical text using C++ or C could.

This distinctive textbook aims to introduce readers to the basic structures of the mechanics of deformable bodies, with a special emphasis on the description of the elastic behavior of simple materials and structures composed by elastic beams.  The authors take a deductive rather than inductive approach and start from a few first, foundational principles.  A wide selection of exercises, many with hints and solutions, are provided throughout and organized in a way that will allow readers to form a link between abstract mathematical concepts and real-world applications.The text begins with the definition of bodies and deformations, keeping the kinematics of rigid bodies as a special case; the authors also distinguish between material and spatial metrics, defining each one in the pertinent space.  Subsequent chapters cover observers and classes of possible changes; forces, torques, and related balances, which are derived from the invariance under classical changes in observers of the power of the external actions over a body, rather than postulated a priori; constitutive structures; variational principles in linear elasticity; the de Saint-Venant problem; yield criteria and a discussion of their role in the representation of material behavior; and an overview of some bifurcation phenomena, focusing on the Euler rod.  An appendix on tensor algebra and tensor calculus is included for readers who need a brief refresher on these topics.Fundamentals of the Mechanics of Solids is primarily intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in various fields of engineering and applied mathematics.  Prerequisites include basic courses in calculus, mathematical analysis, and classical mechanics.

Modern computer simulations make stress analysis easy. As they continue to replace classical mathematical methods of analysis, these software programs require users to have a solid understanding of the fundamental principles on which they are based.  Develop Intuitive Ability to Identify and Avoid Physically Meaningless Predictions  Applied Mechanics of Solids is a powerful tool for understanding how to take advantage of these revolutionary computer advances in the field of solid mechanics. Beginning with a description of the physical and mathematical laws that govern deformation in solids, the text presents modern constitutive equations, as well as analytical and computational methods of stress analysis and fracture mechanics. It also addresses the nonlinear theory of deformable rods, membranes, plates, and shells, and solutions to important boundary and initial value problems in solid mechanics.

Principles of Solid Mechanics,Rowland Richards  Jr.,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/60/8f/f6/608ff670665f15c19443d260b298ce06.jpg,"
                    Evolving from more than 30 years of research and teaching experience, Principles of Solid Mechanics offers an in-depth treatment of the application of the full-range theory of deformable solids for analysis and design. Unlike other texts, it is not either a civil or mechanical engineering text, but both. It treats not only analysis but incorporates design along with experimental observation. Principles of Solid Mechanics serves as a core course textbook for advanced seniors and first-year graduate students. The author focuses on basic concepts and applications, simple yet unsolved problems, inverse strategies for optimum design, unanswered questions, and unresolved paradoxes to intrigue students and encourage further study. He includes plastic as well as elastic behavior in terms of a unified field theory and discusses the properties of field equations and requirements on boundary conditions crucial for understanding the limits of numerical modeling.Designed to help guide students with little experimental experience and no exposure to drawing and graphic analysis, the text presents carefully selected worked examples. The author makes liberal use of footnotes and includes over 150 figures and 200 problems. This, along with his approach, allows students to see the full range, non-linear response of structures.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/511898/2f66e9,458,CRC Press,2000,english,"PDF, 7.08 MB"

                    This is a first year graduate textbook in Linear Elasticity. It is written with the practical engineering reader in mind, dependence on previous knowledge of Solid Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics or Mathematics being minimized. Most of the text should be readily intelligible to a reader with an undergraduate background of one or two courses in elementary Mechanics of Materials and a rudimentary knowledge of partial differentiation. Emphasis is placed on engineering applications of elasticity and examples are generally worked through to final expressions for the stress and displacement fields in order to explore the engineering consequences of the results. The Topics covered were chosen with a view to modern research applications in Fracture Mechanics, Composite Materials, Tribology and Numerical Methods. Thus, significant attention is given to crack and contact problems, problems involving interfaces between dissimilar media, thermo elasticity, singular asymptotic stress fields and three-dimensional problems. This second edition includes new chapters on antiplane stress systems, Saint-Venant torsion and bending and an expanded section on three-dimensional problems in spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems, including axisymmetric torsion of bars of non-uniform circular cross-section. It also includes over 200 end-of-chapter problems, which are expressed wherever possible in the form they would arise in engineering - i.e. as a body of a given geometry subjected to prescribed loading - instead of inviting the student to 'verify' that a given candidate stress function is appropriate to the problem. Solution of these problems is considerably facilitated by the use of modern symbolic mathematical languages such as Maple® and Mathematica® and electronic files and hints on this method of solution can be accessed at the web site www.elasticity.org.

From the characterization of materials to accelerated life testing, experimentation with solids and structures is present in all stages of the design of mechanical devices. Sometimes only an experimental model can bring the necessary elements for understanding, the physics under study just being too complex for an efficient numerical model.   This book presents the classical tools in the experimental approach to mechanical engineering, as well as the methods that have revolutionized the field over the past 20 years: photomechanics, signal processing, statistical data analysis, design of experiments, uncertainty analysis, etc.  Experimental Mechanics of Solids and Structures also replaces mechanical testing in a larger context: firstly, that of the experimental model, with its own hypotheses; then that of the knowledge acquisition process, which is structured and robust; finally, that of a reliable analysis of the results obtained, in a context where uncertainty could be important.   ",https://1lib.in/dl/2713894/3ed8b6,176,Wiley-ISTE,2016,english,"PDF, 8.67 MB"

                    The second edition of An Introduction to Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis has the same objective as the first edition, namely, to facilitate an easy and thorough understanding of the details that are involved in the theoretical formulation, finite element model development, and solutions of nonlinear problems. The book offers an easy-to-understand treatment of the subject of nonlinear finite element analysis, which includes element development from mathematical models and numerical evaluation of the underlying physics. The new edition is extensively reorganized and contains substantial amounts of new material. Chapter 1 in the second edition contains a section on applied functional analysis. Chapter 2 on nonlinear continuum mechanics is entirely new. Chapters 3 through 8 in the new edition correspond to Chapter 2 through 8 of the first edition, but with additional explanations, examples, and exercise problems. Material on time dependent problems from Chapter 8 of the first edition is absorbed into Chapters 4 through 8 of the new edition. Chapter 9 is extensively revised and it contains up to date developments in the large deformation analysis of isotropic, composite and functionally graded shells. Chapter 10 of the first edition on material nonlinearity and coupled problems is reorganized in the second edition by moving the material on solid mechanics to Chapter 12 in the new edition and material on coupled problems to the new chapter, Chapter 10, on weak-form Galerkin finite element models of viscous incompressible fluids. Finally, Chapter 11 in the second edition is entirely new and devoted to least-squares finite element models of viscous incompressible fluids. Chapter 12 of the second edition is enlarged to contain finite element models of viscoelastic beams. In general, all of the chapters of the second edition contain additional explanations, detailed example problems, and additional exercise problems. Although all of the programming segments are in Fortran, the logic used in these Fortran programs is transparent and can be used in Matlab or C++ versions of the same. Thus the new edition more than replaces the first edition, and it is hoped that it is acquired by the library of every institution of higher learning as well as serious finite element analysts.The book may be used as a textbook for an advanced course (after a first course) on the finite element method or the first course on nonlinear finite element analysis.

The design of turbine-generator foundations requires advanced technical expertise in structural engineering and soil dynamics, as well as close collaboration with manufacturers, mechanical and electrical engineers, and plant designers. Various manufacturers have different requirements for such foundations, and application of code provisions can demand a significant degree of interpretation. Concrete Foundations for Turbine Generators: Analysis, Design, and Construction provides the practical assistance needed by structural engineers and facility owners to meet these challenges with the most up-to-date and reliable information available. This Manual of Practice addresses the design of three types of concrete foundations for turbine generators: block foundations, with pedestals, piers, and blocks supported on a common mat foundation (basemat); elevated space-frame pedestal foundations, with columns, walls, and a tabletop supported on the basemat; and foundations where equipment or structural elements are supported on a vibration-isolation system. Topics include turbine generator equipment, foundation layout and sizing, foundation loads and load combinations, modeling of soil and pile response to dynamic loads, finite element modeling, serviceability analysis and acceptance criteria, strength and stability design, embedded items, vibration-isolated foundations, and construction considerations. Three appendixes on dynamic impedance discuss soil-supported rigid foundations, pile-supported foundations, and calculation examples.

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++,Mark A. Weiss,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/10/04/52/100452107988206c2701135ce144cb7b.jpg,"
                    Features
This text is designed to teach students good programming and algorithm analysis skills simultaneously so that they can develop intricate programs with the maximum amount of efficiency.
By analyzing an algorithm before it is actually coded, students can decide if a particular solution will be feasible and see how careful implementations can reduce the time constraint for large amounts of data. No algorithm or data structure is presented without an explanation of its running time.
This book is suitable for either an advanced data structures (CS7) course or a first-year graduate course in algorithm analysis. As introductory sequences expand from two to three courses, this book is ideal at the end of the third course, bridging the way to the Algorithms course.
Discussion of algorithm and design techniques covers greedy algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, randomized algorithms, and backtracking.
Covers topics and data structures such as Fibonacci heaps, skew heaps, binomial queue, skip lists and splay trees. 
A full chapter on amortized analysis examines the advanced data structures presented earlier in the book.
Chapter on advanced data structures and their implementation covers red black trees, top down splay trees, k-d trees, pairing heaps, and more. 
End-of-chapter exercises, ranked by difficulty, reinforce the material from the chapter while providing readers an opportunity to put those concepts into practice.

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ is an advanced algorithms book that bridges the gap between traditional CS2 and Algorithms Analysis courses.
As the speed and power of computers increases, so does the need for effective programming and algorithm analysis. By approaching these skills in tandem, Mark Allen Weiss teaches readers to develop well-constructed, maximally efficient programs using the C++ programming language.
This book explains topics from binary heaps to sorting to NP-completeness, and dedicates a full chapter to amortized analysis and advanced data structures and their implementation. Figures and examples illustrating successive stages of algorithms contribute to Weiss’ careful, rigorous and in-depth analysis of each type of algorithm.

An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms,Robert Sedgewick,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/7c/be/aa/7cbeaa9dc0cf8fada4aa644c3348cda9.jpg,"
                    Despite growing interest, basic information on methods and models for mathematically analyzing algorithms has rarely been directly accessible to practitioners, researchers, or students. An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms, Second Edition, organizes and presents that knowledge, fully introducing primary techniques and results in the field. Robert Sedgewick and the late Philippe Flajolet have drawn from both classical mathematics and computer science, integrating discrete mathematics, elementary real analysis, combinatorics, algorithms, and data structures. They emphasize the mathematics needed to support scientific studies that can serve as the basis for predicting algorithm performance and for comparing different algorithms on the basis of performance. Techniques covered in the first half of the book include recurrences, generating functions, asymptotics, and analytic combinatorics. Structures studied in the second half of the book include permutations, trees, strings, tries, and mappings. Numerous examples are included throughout to illustrate applications to the analysis of algorithms that are playing a critical role in the evolution of our modern computational infrastructure. Improvements and additions in this new edition include:• Upgraded figures and code• An all-new chapter introducing analytic combinatorics• Simplified derivations via analytic combinatorics throughout• The book’s thorough, self-contained coverage will help readers appreciate the field’s challenges, prepare them for advanced results—covered in their monograph Analytic Combinatorics and in Donald Knuth’s The Art of Computer Programming books—and provide the background they need to keep abreast of new research.

A breakthrough trading book that provides powerful insights on profitable technical patterns and strategiesThe Art and Science of Technical Analysisis a groundbreaking work that bridges the gaps between the academic view of markets, technical analysis, and profitable trading. The book explores why randomness prevails in markets most, but not all, of the time and how technical analysis can be used to capture statistically validated patterns in certain types of market conditions. The belief of the book is that buying and selling pressure causes patterns in prices, but that these technical patterns are only effective in the presence of true buying/selling imbalance.The Art and Science of Technical Analysisis supported by extensive statistical analysis of the markets, which will debunk some tools and patterns such as Fibonacci analysis, and endorse other tools and trade setups. In addition, this reliable resource discusses trader psychology and trader learning curves based on the author's extensive experience as a trader and trainer of traders.Offers serious traders a way to think about market problems, understand their own performance, and help find a more productive path forward Includes extensive research to validate specific money-making patterns and strategies Written by an experienced market practitioner who has trained and worked with many top traders Filled with in-depth insights and practical advice,The Art and Science of Technical Analysiswill give you a realistic sense of how markets behave, when and how technical analysis works, and what it really takes to trade successfully.

Presents a novel approach to conducting meta-analysis using structural equation modeling. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and meta-analysis are two powerful statistical methods in the educational, social, behavioral, and medical sciences. They are often treated as two unrelated topics in the literature. This book presents a unified framework on analyzing meta-analytic data within the SEM framework, and illustrates how to conduct meta-analysis using the metaSEM package in the R statistical environment. Meta-Analysis: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach begins by introducing the importance of SEM and meta-analysis in answering research questions. Key ideas in meta-analysis and SEM are briefly reviewed, and various meta-analytic models are then introduced and linked to the SEM framework. Fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models in univariate and multivariate meta-analyses, three-level meta-analysis, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling, are introduced. Advanced topics, such as using restricted maximum likelihood estimation method and handling missing covariates, are also covered.  Readers will learn a single framework to apply both meta-analysis and SEM.  Examples in R and in Mplus are included.  This book will be a valuable resource for statistical and academic researchers and graduate students carrying out meta-analyses, and will also be useful to researchers and statisticians using SEM in biostatistics. Basic knowledge of either SEM or meta-analysis will be helpful in understanding the materials in this book. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2545140/8eb2d0,408,Wiley,2015,english,"PDF, 2.15 MB"

                    New York: McGraw-Hill book company, Inc., 1916. — 504 p.Volumes II and III are essentially devoted to a presentation of the fundamental principles and problems of irrigation engineering. While the author has endeavored to meet specially the needs of teachers and students in technical schools, considerable descriptive information and cost data have been added for the purpose of making these volumes more valuable to the engineers engaged in the construction and operation of irrigation systems. For use as text-books in class-room work, some of the descriptive material and detailed information may be considered only briefly and more emphasis laid on the fundamental principles and on the problems of economic construction.The preparation of these two volumes results in part from the development of a course in Irrigation engineering presented at the University of California. It is based on an acquaintance with a large number of irrigation systems, located in most of the States of the western part of the United States and in western Canada, obtained through many opportunities for examinationof these projects and through connection with a number of them.The writer has not confined himself to his own experience and observations, but has discussed the principles of irrigation engineering presented in this work with a number of successful engineers, who have had much experience in the construction and operation of irrigation systems. He has also availed himself not only of contemporary literature pertaining to American Irrigation engineering, but has consulted a large collection of foreign publications, mostly from India, Egypt, Spain and France. While there is still considerable difference of opinion among engineers regarding some of the principles of design of irrigation works, it is believed that the opinions and principles presented are in accordance with correct theory and good practice as demonstrated by careful observation.This treatise on irrigation engineering, as presented in Volumes II and III, is largely confined to canals and other works which pertain to the usual types of irrigation systems. No attempt has been made to discuss the subject of dams used for the development of storage, and of high masonry dams used for the diversion of water. Excellent books on dams made it unnecessary and undesirable to include a brief presentation of this subject. On the other hand, much space has been devoted to a rather complete consideration of low dams used for diversion weirs.The division of this work in two volumes has been made primarily to avoid an excessively bulky book in one volume.The division has had to be made more or less arbitrarily. Volume II, on The Conveyance of Water, begins with three chapters which pertain to irrigation engineering as a whole, and Volume III, on Irrigation Structures and Distribution System, contains chapters which are closely related to the conveyance of water.

                    New York: McGraw-Hill book company, Inc., 1915. — 254 p.In the preparation of this volume and of the two following larger volumes, the author has endeavored to present a book which will fill the needs of teachers and students in technicalcolleges and universities and which may be used as a reference book by engineers engaged in irrigation work, by managers and superintendents of irrigation systems. In this work the writer has been guided by his experience as a teacher of irrigation practice and engineering for many years and by experience obtained through his professional practice, which has given him opportunities to become acquainted with irrigation practice and projects in most of the states of the western part of the United States and in western Canada.Personal contact with engineers engaged in irrigation work, examination of their reports and plans for proposed irrigation systems and inspection of constructed systems show that engineerswho have had little experience in irrigation work have not considered the relative importance of the agricultural phase of irrigation problems. The planning and construction of an irrigation system cannot be totally separated from the operation of the system. On nearly all new projects the completion of the construction of a system and the operation of the system must be carried on at the same time, usually both under the direction of the chief engineer. Where an old system is to be extended, construction and operation must be carried jointly. It usually develops that the experience obtained by the engineer in planning and constructing a system makes him the best qualified man to operate the system, and not infrequently does he become the manager of the project. For these reasons it is important that a treatise on irrigation engineering be preceded by an introductory part on the use of irrigation water and irrigation practice.

Mr. Wilson's familiarity with those works, based largely on personal contact with them and their builders and operators, gave the early editions of his work a special value as contributions to western knowledge of this subject.The subsequent activity in irrigation in other parts of the world, especially in the United States, together with similar developments in related lines of municipal water supply and hydro-electric construction, have presented new problems and evolved new solutions of old ones to such an extent that what might almost be called a new science has been developed, requiring different treatment. Moreover, social, political and ewe nomic conditions in America are radically different from those in the Orient, and this imposes very different conditions and limitations upon the practice of irrigation engineering.

                    World population is set to increase by a third in the next 25 years, with no corresponding increase in global rainfall. About seventy per cent of the world's abstracted water is used in farming and therefore the economics of irrigation is becoming an increasingly important issue for sustainable development. Water for Agriculture provides a thorough overview of this highly topical subject, written in a clear and accessible style.The Scope of the book is wide both in its analysis and in its geographical coverage. Topics covered include the infrastructure, operation and maintenance of irrigation service supply, the supply of drainage services, economic cost benefit analysis, water resource planning at the regional scale, political economy and irrigation policy. The content of Water for Agriculture is enhanced by numerous tables, diagrams, and in-depth case studies.This book will be an essential read for those professionals involved in the planning of water resources, and for advanced students studying this topic as part of agriculture, development studies, economics, engineering, environmental science, geography, hydrology and planning courses.

                    The new edition of Garber and Hoel's best-selling text focuses on giving students insight into all facets of traffic and highway engineering. Students generally come to this course with little knowledge or understanding of the importance of transportation, much less of the extensive career opportunities within the field. Transportation is an extremely broad field, and courses must either cover all transportation modes or focus on specifics. While many topics can be covered with a survey approach, this often lacks sufficient depth and students leave the course without a full understanding of any of the fields. This text focuses exclusively on traffic and highway engineering beginning with a discussion of the pivotal role transportation plays in our society, including employment opportunities, historical impact, and the impact of transportation on our daily lives. This approach gives students a sense of what the field is about as well as an opportunity to consider some of its challenges. Later chapters focus on specific issues facing transportation engineers. The text uses pedagogical tools such as worked problems, diagrams and tables, reference material, and realistic examples to demonstrate how the material is applied.

                    Although technology and productivity has changed much of engineering, many topics are still taught in very similarly to how they were taught in the 70s. Using a new approach to engineering economics, Systems Life Cycle Costing: Economic Analysis, Estimation, and Management presents the material that a modern engineer must understand to work as a practicing engineer conducting economic analysis.   Organized around a product development process that provides a framework for the material, the book presents techniques such as engineering economics and simulation-based costing (SBC), with a focus on total life cycle understanding and perspective and introduces techniques for detailed analysis of modern complex systems. The author includes rules of thumb for estimation grouped with the methods, processes, and tools (MPTs) for conducting a detailed engineering buildup for costing. He presents the estimating costing of complex systems and software and then explores concepts such as design to cost (DTC), cost as an independent variable (CAIV), the role of commercial off-the-shelf technology, cost of quality, and the role of project management in LCC management.  No product or services are immune from cost, performance, schedule, quality, risks, and tradeoffs. Yet engineers spend most of their formal education focused on performance and most of their professional careers worrying about resources and schedule. Too often, the design stage becomes about the technical performance without considering the downstream costs that contribute to the tota1 life cycle costs (LCC) of a system. This text presents the methods, processes, and tools needed for the economic analysis, estimation, and management that bring these costs in line with the goals of pleasing the customer and staying within budget.
