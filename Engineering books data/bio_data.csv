                    This award-winning science book uses the latest findings from neuroscience research and brain-imaging technology to take you on a journey into the human brain.

CGI artworks and brain MRI scans reveal the brain's anatomy in unprecedented detail. Step-by-step sequences unravel and simplify the complex processes of brain function, such as how nerves transmit signals, how memories are laid down and recalled, and how we register emotions. The book answers fundamental and compelling questions about the brain: what does it mean to be conscious, what happens when we're asleep, and are the brains of men and women different?

This is an accessible and authoritative reference book to a fascinating part of the human body. Thanks to improvements in scanning technology, our understanding of the brain is changing quickly. Now in its third edition, The Human Brain Book provides an up-to-date guide to one of science's most exciting frontiers. With its coverage of more than 50 brain-related diseases and disorders--from strokes to brain tumors and schizophrenia--it is also an essential manual for students and healthcare professionals.

To build electronic projects that can sense the physical world, you need to build circuits based around sensors: electronic components that react to physical phenomena by sending an electrical signal. Even with only basic electronic components, you can build useful and educational sensor projects.But if you incorporate Arduino or Raspberry Pi into your project, you can build much more sophisticated projects that can react in interesting ways and even connect to the Internet. This book starts by teaching you the basic electronic circuits to read and react to a sensor. It then goes on to show how to use Arduino to develop sensor systems, and wraps up by teaching you how to build sensor projects with the Linux-powered Raspberry Pi.

Measuring Current Voltage and Power Handbook of Sensors and Actuators Vol 7,K. Iwansson,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/34/9f/bb/349fbba1480936c2a76cd90f18ccf21f.jpg,"
This authoritative new book focuses on recent developments in the instrumentation for sending voltages and currents. It covers new trends and challenges in the field, such as measurements of biocurrents, the increased speed of the components for data taking, testing of computers and integrated circuits where the measurement of rapid voltage and current variations on a very small geometrical scale is necessary. The first chapter concentrates on recent methods to sense voltages and currents, while the rest of the book investigates the applied side, covering for instance electrical power and energy measurements. The main purpose of this volume is to illustrate commonly employed techniques rather than track the scientific evolution and merits and therefore mainly covers patent literature aimed at industrial applications. It is an exciting addition, justifying the series' claim to cover state-of-the-art developments in both the applied and theoretical fields of sensors and actuators.The measurement of voltages and currents is a common task in the field of electricity and electronics. From a technical point of view it is useful to identify schematically different steps of such a measurement. In a first step a voltage or a current is sensed, intermediate steps such as amplification, transmission and further treatment may follow to yield the result in the final step. Today in most cases microprocessors perform the final steps of such measurements. Analog-to digital converters digitise a voltage that is proportional to the value to be measured and a processor performs further computations and handles the storage and the display of the results. The prerequisite for such measurements are sensors or transducers that respond in a known way to the voltage or current to be measured. The emphasis of this book is put on recent developments of the instrumentation for sensing voltages and currents.Aside from the general trend towards smaller, cheaper and more reliable instrumentation, new demands have arisen. New applications, like measurements of biocurrents, ask for higher sensitivities. Computers and integrated circuits pose new challenges. To exploit the increased speed of the components for data taking, suitable sensors are required. The accuracy that can be achieved depends more than ever on the first step, the acquisition of the raw data. The influence of the measurement process on the results becomes more crucial. Testing of integrated circuits themselves is a completely new application. For such tests one has to measure rapid voltage and current variations on very small geometrical scales. Here, as well as in the traditional high voltage applications, contactless measurements play an important role.The organisation of this book is as follows: In the first chapter different methods to sense voltages and currents are described. For the sake of completeness most commonly used methods are mentioned, we concentrate, however, on those developed recently. The chapters address the subject from the side of different applications in which voltages and currents are sensed.Since the main purpose of this publication is to illustrate commonly employed techniques rather than to track the scientific evolution and merits in particular fields, in general those publications that illustrate a particular measurement principle best have been cited. The citation of a particular reference does therefore not imply that this is the first or most pertinent publication in the respective field.

                    To build electronic projects that can sense the physical world, you need to build circuits based around sensors: electronic components that react to physical phenomena by sending an electrical signal. Even with only basic electronic components, you can build useful and educational sensor projects.  But if you incorporate Arduino or Raspberry Pi into your project, you can build much more sophisticated projects that can react in interesting ways and even connect to the Internet. This book starts by teaching you the basic electronic circuits to read and react to a sensor. It then goes on to show how to use Arduino to develop sensor systems, and wraps up by teaching you how to build sensor projects with the Linux-powered Raspberry Pi.

                    The field of electrical measurement continues to grow, with new techniques developed each year. From the basic thermocouple to cutting-edge virtual instrumentation, it is also becoming an increasingly ""digital"" endeavor. Books that attempt to capture the state-of-the-art in electrical measurement are quickly outdated. Recognizing the need for a text devoted to the major areas underlying modern electrical measurement, Slawomir Tumanski developed Principles of Electrical Measurement.This text builds a solid foundation in the necessary background concepts and fundamentals needed to develop and use modern electrical instruments. The author first introduces the fundamentals-including main terms and definitions, methods of estimating accuracy and uncertainty, and standards of electrical quantities-and the classical methods of measurement. He then delves into data acquisition, signal conditioning, and signal processing for both analog and digital signals. The final chapter examines computer measuring systems and virtual measurement techniques. By focusing on the aspects that are common to all types of electrical measurement, the book ensures a solid understanding that can be easily applied in practice.Whether used as an introduction to the field or as a reference to the essential concepts, Principles of Electrical Measurement provides the knowledge necessary to develop measurement solutions for any application.

                    This book deals with the past, present, and future of flow, sensors, and measurement. It is called The Tao of Measurement because, like the Tao itself, it reveals the underlying principles of flow and measurement. It explains the engineering and physics of flow and sensors, how our units of measurement were derived, present day measurement practices, and how today s scientific tools can improve our units of measurement. It s a must-read for anyone involved in instrumentation or process control. The book s opening chapters explore the technologies of temperature, pressure, and flow measurement. The authors reveal the history of units of measurement and describe how they came to be used today. The book then presents a thorough discussion of the different types of temperature sensors, pressure transmitters, and flowmeters. It contains an explanation of applications, and then comments on trends in sensors and measurement. Each chapter includes a handy glossary of units of measurement. The authors then turn their attention to three very familiar but vital subjects: time, length and area. They trace the origins of today s units of measurement for these variables, all the way back to Greek and Roman times, then follow their development to today s atomic clocks and the standard meter, now defined in terms of wavelengths of light. This book describes how modern technology can be used to improve units of measurement. It paints a picture of a dynamic and changing universe, one in which systems can be integrated with improved measurement practices. It looks beyond the static nature of everyday objects to an underlying reality that is dynamic and changing. It describes the technologies that are available to effectively configure a cost-effective system, and then shows how to integrate this system with the most powerful sensors and tools of flow measurement. Systems and instrumentation, the yin and yang of the automation world, are finally united in a synthesis that comes from seeing both from a single perspective. The Tao of measurement is revealed, and in the end, it is all about flow. Each section of the book can be used as a standalone handbook or as a readable engineering manual. Questions? Comments?

                    Time-frequency analyses are critical for characterizing and understanding systems in many areas of science and engineering. This low-cost book focuses on practical implementations of the analyses in Matlab/Octave. The book explains time-frequency analyses through written explanations and many figures, rather than through opaque mathematical equations. Each of 120 figures in the book corresponds to Matlab code that is available in the book and online (sincxpress.com), and can be run, inspected, and modified on any computer. By reading this book and working through the exercises, the reader will gain the knowledge and skills to apply frequency and time-frequency analyses to simulated and to real data. The book also includes introductions to non-frequency-dependent time series analyses including stationarity and de-noising.

                    Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is increasingly being diagnosed in people of all ages, and this book demonstrates how art therapy can not only assist with diagnosis, but also provides a valuable means of helping to improve skills such as concentration and focus, boost self-esteem, and cope with impulsivity. Educational social skills art groups can help with understanding of AD/HD in addition to teaching strategies to relieve the symptoms. Art therapy is also important for alleviating feelings of isolation and confusion that may come with the diagnosis, and, as an ongoing process, it can be a useful tool for checking clients' progress from the initial assessment onwards. In the first part of her book, the author explores ways of using art therapy and of setting up art therapy groups. Her advice and practical suggestions will be useful to anyone with an interest in AD/HD. The later chapters offer therapists more detailed guidance on therapy sessions with clients with AD/HD.  Practical and informative, and based on the author's long experience with art therapy and AD/HD, this will be a valuable book for therapists, mental health professionals, and people who live or work with AD/HD.

                    The Childhood Hand that Disturbs (CHaD), a new projective test, is a diagnostic and therapeutic tool that is broadly applicable, but particularly effective with abused, depressed, and suicidal subjects. While the CHaD has the advantage of being quick and easy to administer--it takes an average of ten minutes to perform--it is reliable and applicable to both young and old. It is a useful complement to traditional batteries such as the Rorschach and Draw-a-Family, and self-assessment questionnaires. What makes the CHaD different is that it is a free drawing exam, and one that taps one of the most highly symbolic parts of the body: the hand. The CHaD has been tested on normal and pathological individuals for over ten years. Clear guidelines can now be set down for administration, testing, and interpretation. Obviously, a projective test can never be more sensitive than the professional who uses it, but it is Davido's intention that the theoretical underpinnings and her presentations of case studies along with the drawings will help other practitioners deal better with the needs of their patients.

The Emotional Life Interview: A Psychosocial Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedure,Henry,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/67/3f/55/673f5587ec79dce0ff7d18d773b4a881.jpg,"
                    The purpose of this book is to introduce mental health professionals to the Emotional Life Interview that offers therapy to those with mental health problems in a more effective and time-sensitive process. It meets today s pressures to provide essential care at less cost. The Emotional Life Interview (ELI) involves asking each client seven questions about five negative feelings and emotions (fear, anger, shame, guilt, and sadness) and six questions about two positive feelings and emotions (pride and happiness). The process takes the practitioner into the emotional life of a client as no other procedure does. Major sections of the book discuss feelings, emotions, and psychotherapy; meaning, arousal, and the construction of emotions; and the use of the ELI in psychosocial treatment. In addition, nine complete chapters are devoted to case histories which illustrate how important feelings, emotions, and relationships are in mental health problems. These case study interviews become conversations in which the clients reveal the character of their consciousness with respect to their emotional lives. The ELI questions presented in the case studies require clients to represent their thoughts and actions in words and to tell their emotional life stories in a manner that is itself therapeutic. The life stories show in bold relief where changes are needed. The Emotional Life Interview provides a framework for emotional life education. The interview puts diagnosis and psychotherapy on the same continuum and makes therapy and emotional life education a viable healthcare option. The book represents a valuable new tool for all clinical and counseling psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatrists, and primary care providers. It will also serve as a resource in the helping professions, welfare work, and human services.

The Leiden-Edinburgh Boerhaave Course on 'The Gastro-intestinal Tract', held in Leiden on October 29 and 30, 1969, resulted from the renewed co-operation between the Medical Faculties of Edinburgh and Leiden, based on very old ties. As one will know, the Edinburgh Faculty of Medi­ cine was founded in 1726 on the principles guiding the Leiden Faculty of Medicine at that time, on the instigation of John Monro I, who had studied medicine in Leiden under the famous Boerhaave. These old ties were revived some 8 years ago, first by students, later by the Faculties themselves, with the special purpose to facilitate and en­ large the exchange of medical knowledge between two medical centres. One of the results of this was that it was considered whether physicians from both countries could not profit from the knowledge gained specific­ ally in both these faculties by letting the investigators from both faculties tell about their work within the framework of courses for post-academic medical training, in Leiden called the 'Boerhaave Courses'.

This book presents a new meta-heuristic algorithm, inspired by the self-defense mechanisms of plants in nature. Numerous published works have demonstrated the various self-defense mechanisms (survival strategies) plants use to protect themselves against predatory organisms, such as herbivorous insects. The proposed algorithm is based on the predator–prey mathematical model originally proposed by Lotka and Volterra, consisting of two nonlinear first-order differential equations, which allow the growth of two interacting populations (prey and predator) to be modeled. The proposed meta-heuristic is able to produce excellent results in several sets of benchmark optimization problems. Further, fuzzy logic is used for dynamic parameter adaptation in the algorithm.

This book deals with the adhesion, friction and contact mechanics of living organisms. Further, it presents the remarkable adhesive abilities of the living organisms which inspired the design of novel micro- and nanostructured adhesives that can be used in various applications, such as climbing robots, reusable tapes, and biomedical bandages. The technologies for both the synthesis and construction of bio-inspired adhesive micro- and nanostructures, as well as their performance, are discussed in detail. Representatives of several animal groups, such as insects, spiders, tree frogs, and lizards, are able to walk on (and therefore attach to) tilted, vertical surfaces, and even ceilings in different environments. Studies have demonstrated that their highly specialized micro- and nanostructures, in combination with particular surface chemistries, are responsible for this impressive and reversible adhesion. These structures can maximize the formation of large effective contact areas on surfaces of varying roughness and chemical composition under different environmental conditions.

                    In recent years, substantial advances have been made in understanding the coupling between chemical and biological processes and mechanical and hydraulic behaviours in soils and rocks. At the same time, experimentation and modelling capabilities have progressed significantly, allowing effective design of geotechnical applications. The need for such analyses arises, for example, in chemical and biological soil improvement; nuclear, hazardous and municipal waste containment; petroleum and natural gas extraction; methane hydrate exploitation; CO2 sequestration; and assessment of pavement durability.

The seventeenth Géotechnique Symposium in Print took place at the Institution of Civil Engineers on 3 June 2013 and sought to address the new challenges that are emerging from the interactions between multi-physical phenomena. These proceedings bring together the international research presented at the symposium and published across two issues of Géotechnique as well as additional subsequent research published in the journal.

The papers selected for the symposium cover a wide range of geotechnical processes, including:

- Experimental analysis and constitutive modelling of the bio- and chemo-mechanical behaviour of geomaterials.
- Effects of changes in the pore water chemistry on soil and rock behaviour.
- Interactions between geometrical scales of diverse biological, chemical, physical and mechanical processes.
- Case studies of chemical and biological soil modifications.
- Applications of bio- and chemo-mechanical models in emerging technologies.

This monograph presents the latest results related to bio-mechanical systems and materials. The bio-mechanical systems with which his book is concerned are prostheses, implants, medical operation robots and muscular re-training systems. To characterize and design such systems, a multi-disciplinary approach is required which involves the classical disciplines of mechanical/materials engineering and biology and medicine. The challenge in such an approach is that views, concepts or even language are sometimes different from discipline to discipline and the interaction and communication of the scientists must be first developed and adjusted. Within the context of materials' science, the book covers the interaction of materials with mechanical systems, their description as a mechanical system or their mechanical properties.

                    Buried waste on the seabed is a major source of pollution. But, very often, waste sites are not known until aserious problem occurs, or are not adequately mapped. Recent examples around Europe include WWI and WWII ammunition dump sites (e.g. Beufort Dyke in the UK), dumped nuclear submarines in the Arctic Seas, clandestine or hidden toxic-waste in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea.. Even if properly documented, waste sites evolve with time (dumped material can movewith currents and tides, especially on a scale of decades; toxic-material barrels can corrode and leak). This book shows the results of a concerted EU-funded effort to tackle this problem and find innovative ways to identify and map toxic waste sites ona the seabed, whether they have been covered with sediments or not. These results are applicable to any region on the seabed in the entire world.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/679034/526837,244,Springer,2006,english,"PDF, 7.05 MB"
