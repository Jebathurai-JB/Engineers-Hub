Mathematical physics (Mathematical Methods for Physical Science),Derek Raine,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/84/20/95/842095bcdcf5a8891257be043a10980d.jpg,"
                    The book differs from other introduction to mathematical methods
at this level in several important areas.
First, it does not follow the usual presentation of a description of
the theory followed by examples and exercises. Rather we use examples
to introduce the theory. This approach is not new; it goes back
to the methods by which the scribes of Ancient Babylon learned
mathematics: by example problems and, to judge from the numbers
of surviving cuneiform tablets, lots of them!
Second, to help the reader digest the text, it is broken up into
quite short sections (often a page or so) followed by exercises. It may
be tempting to skip the exercises, (especially if one is used to doing
only a selection of “end-of-chapter” problems) on the grounds that
one can get through the book more quickly that way. This is true, in
the same sense that watching a film speeded up x8 will get to the end
more quickly, but it will be without much understanding of the plot.
There are optional additional exercises at the end of each chapter;
the ones in the text represent the minimum we think you need.
Third, however, we have tried to avoid too many “plug-andchug”
exercises, that is, exercises which you solve by following the
text but substituting some different numbers (“pattern matching”).
These are useful to reinforce memory, but they are not very useful
to develop or test understanding. Rather, we have tried to make the
exercises diagnostic in the sense that they do test understanding,
that is, they test the ability to use what has been learned in a slightly
different context. An instructor can therefore use these to target
support for students.

Finally, and related to the previous point, while we hope it is perfectly possible to use this book for self-study, it was not designed for that purpose. It is intended for use as a course text. In this regard it might be useful to say a little about the background to the writing of the book - especially if you are intrigued to know why there are so many authors. We would also like to thank contributions to various versions of the text from Paul Abel, Mike Dampier, Andrew King, and Tim Yeoman.
About forty years ago, it was agreed that our conventional
presentation of mathematical methods for our physics students -
lectures, marked homework,and examinations - was not as effective as we might have hoped. So, instead of spending lecture time going through theory and exercises on the board, we produced a text as, in effect, the lecture notes, and refocused class time on weekly workshops and small group tutorials. Lectures were restricted to a weekly one-hour introduction to the topics for that week. We made the examinations harder, by requiring passes separately in the major topics
(calculus of one variable, many variables, linear algebra, differential equations, vector calculus) and the pass rates soared. The initial text has been refined over the years (hence the number of authors) and this book is another, more outward-facing version, which we are pleased to have the opportunity to share with you.

                    Many students of physical and applied science and of engineering find difficulty in copying with the mathematics necessary for the quantitative manipulation of the physical concepts they are atudying in their main course. This book is designed to help first and second year under-graduates at universities and polytechnics, as well as technical college students, to find their feet in the important mathematical methods they will need. Throughout the text the physical relevance of the mathematics is constantly stressed and, where it is helpful, use has been made of pictorial mathematics and qualitative verbal descriptions instead of over-compact mathematical symbolism. Topics are presented in three stages: a qualitative introduction, a more formal presentation and an explicit check or worked example. There are many exercises included in the text which are aimed at testing a student's understanding and building his confidence progressively throughout each piece of work                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2031066/eefd31,549,Cambridge University Press,1974,english,"PDF, 14.04 MB"

                    For over thirty years, Stan Amos has provided students and practitioners with a text they could rely on to keep them at the forefront of transistor circuit design. This seminal work has now been presented in a clear new format and completely updated to include the latest equipment such as laser diodes, Trapatt diodes, optocouplers and GaAs transistors, and the most recent line output stages and switch-mode power supplies. Although integrated circuits have widespread application, the role of discrete transistors is undiminished, both as important building blocks which students must understand and as practical solutions to design problems, especially where appreciable power output or high voltage is required.  New circuit techniques covered for the first time in this edition include current-dumping amplifiers, bridge output stages, dielectric resonator oscillators, crowbar protection circuits, thyristor field timebases, low-noise blocks and SHF amplifiers in satellite receivers, video clamps, picture enhancement circuits, motor drive circuits in video recorders and camcorders, and UHF modulators. The plan of the book remains the same: semiconductor physics is introduced, followed by details of the design of transistors, amplifiers, receivers, oscillators and generators. Appendices provide information on transistor manufacture and parameters, and a new appendix on transistor letter symbols has been included                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2280255/329088,397,Newnes,1994,english,"PDF, 5.95 MB"

In radio and television receivers and video recorders, for example, most of the functions are carried out by integrated circuits. Nevertheless there is still a role for discrete transistors, particularly where appreciable power output for high-voltage operation is required. There are, for example, 30 in a 1989 model colour television receiver and considerably more in a video recorder. Discrete transistors are also likely to be used in experimental work and in the early stages of design of electronic equipment.

Digital signal processing (DSP) has been applied to a very wide range of applications. This includes voice processing, image processing, digital communications, the transfer of data over the internet, image and data compression, etc. Engineers who develop DSP applications today, and in the future, will need to address many implementation issues including mapping algorithms to computational structures, computational efficiency, power dissipation, the effects of finite precision arithmetic, throughput and hardware implementation. It is not practical to cover all of these in a single text. However, this text emphasizes the practical implementation of DSP algorithms as well as the fundamental theories and analytical procedures that form the basis for modern DSP applications.Digital Signal Processing: Principles, Algorithms and System Designprovides an introduction to the principals of digital signal processing along with a balanced analytical and practical treatment of algorithms and applications for digital signal processing. It is intended to serve as a suitable text for a one semester junior or senior level undergraduate course.

                    In today’s digital design environment, engineers must achieve quick turn-around time with ready accesses to circuit synthesis and simulation applications. This type of productivity relies on the principles and practices of computer aided design (CAD).

The authors begin by discussing conventional and unconventional number systems, binary coding theories, and arithmetic as well as logic functions and Boolean algebra.  Building upon classic theories of digital systems, the book illustrates the importance of logic minimization using the Karnaugh map technique. It continues by discussing implementation options and examining the pros and cons of each method in addition to an assessment of tradeoffs that often accompany design practices.  The book also covers testability, emphasizing that a good digital design must be easy to verify and test with the lowest cost possible. Throughout the text, the authors analyze combinational and sequential logic elements and illustrate the designs of these components in structural, hierarchical, and behavior VHDL descriptions.

                    Any well-conceived print or Web design features the dynamic interplay between visual artistry and technical skill. It becomes important, therefore, for the designer to cultivate an aesthetic eye as well as develop a high degree of computer savvy.  By combining basic theory with hands-on technique, Digital Design for Print and Web takes the unique approach of uniting two subjects traditionally approached separately into one complete volume. As a result, you will gain a clearer understanding of the entire creative process, from project management to working with graphics to designing for print and, ultimately, the Web.

                    I'm in my early 60's and I'm now back in school studying electronics engineering.  This book was used in one of my first back to college classes in 38 years.  I don't remember much math, but was able to understand the concepts in this book.  Yes it's hard and condensed.  I would like to see an idiot's version of Boolean Algebra that holds your hand more, but this book and my Professor got me through.  Thanks Dr. Luca!  For the first time in my life I now have a basic understanding of how a microprocessor and other digital logic electronic circuits work.  Out of what I learned in this text, concepts were put into a patent application filed this summer.  This invention would not have been as profound without having studied from this book.  All from 1 semester of studying electronics engineering.  I have much to learn, including computer programming as used in this book, such as the HDL languages.  This book includes 3 versions of HDL's: ABEL, VHDL, and Verilog.  You can pick and choose.  We used VHDL in my class.  For electronics engineering students with math and programming experience, this book should be great.  When I first went to college, everyone used slide rules!  There were no personal computers.  You learned Fortran on a main frame and hoped you did not make a mistake and have a tractor drive printer turn your $50.00 box of perf paper into nonsense within a few minutes.  $50.00 was a lot of money to a poor student then.  The minimum wage was $1.25!   But I learned a lot as a beginner with this book.  Cool jokes in the book.  Had fun in digital and even designed a vacuum tube into a digital circuit.  I had to explain what a tube is to the lab instructor.  Several professors thought that was cool.  A senior professor, head of graduate electronics engineering, really lit up when I told him about the tube.  He said, when I was a graduate student, the faculty built a digital computer using tubes and I got to program it!  Had a great time!  For those interested, the tube was a directly heated, subminiature pentode with a filament voltage of 1.25 and a plate voltage of 15 volts.  It was stuck into a clock line just for a reason to be there. The circuit would quit without the tube. Fun!!  For fun, it would be neat to find out if John Wakerly knows what a tube is!                ",https://1lib.in/dl/737902/a02761,927,Prentice Hall,2000,english,"PDF, 8.08 MB"

                    Book provides good basics for people wanted to know it in simple words and samples. But it has some problems with terms definition. I was really confused by the definition of termEncapsulation - is a technique of linking together attributes and procedures to form an object. IT IS TERRIBLE MISTAKE, Booch and other says it is about another thing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_science).Encapsulation is the hiding of the internal mechanisms and data structures of a software component behind a defined interface, in such a way that users of the component (other pieces of software) only need to know what the component does, and cannot make themselves dependent on the details of how it does it.  Book provides Sensible view on real-world problems of OOP implementation, this is really cool, I have many doubts why my programs can't strictly follow OOP paradigm, and I found the answer - because OOP is not a silver bullet for real world applications development. Sometimes it brings overcomplexity which is hard to maintain. And which does not satisfy application's business goals. But mostly this book is lack of reasonable big samples, especially in Real-world modelling chapter. So a lot of theory is not proved there with good samples.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/677525/b79239,262,McGraw-Hill/Osborne,2004,english,"PDF, 3.30 MB"

From COBOL to OOP,Markus Knasmüller (Auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/e0/1f/b8/e01fb8c4c0ddd5fef2f6525219bf8c11.jpg,"
                    Driven by the year-2000 problem, the hordes of COBOL developers experienced a renaissance, but the times when COBOL was state-of-the-art are long gone. Object-orientation, application servers, web front-ends, and relational database systems dominate the scene for new projects today. The fact remains however, that millions of lines of source code written in the structured programming language COBOL work daily on computer systems all over the world. One problem that COBOL developers have to deal with on these new projects is familiarity with object-oriented concepts. Markus Knasmüller, rich with experiences of OO projects in COBOL development teams, offers a successful introduction for the experienced COBOL programmer. A careful approach across techniques familiar to COBOL developers and discussions of current standards make this book easily accessible and understandable.                                       *A practical approach to OOP using the concepts and techniques familiar to the experienced COBOL programmer.*Written independently from any specific programming environment, and all programming examples written in both Delphi and Java. *Detailed case study describing the successful migration of 10 million lines of COBOL code to object-oriented programming.*Companion CD-ROM containing all tutorial sections of the book in PowerPoint and all sample solutions to the problems ready for compilation                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2282052/ee4140,361,Morgan Kaufmann,2001,english,"PDF, 2.60 MB"

Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste.  This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. Information Dashboard Design will explain how to:     Avoid the thirteen mistakes common to dashboard design  Provide viewers with the information they need quickly and clearly  Apply what we now know about visual perception to the visual presentation of information  Minimize distractions, cliches, and unnecessary embellishments that create confusion  Organize business information to support meaning and usability  Create an aesthetically pleasing viewing experience  Maintain consistency of design to provide accurate interpretation  Optimize the power of dashboard technology by pairing it with visual effectiveness     Stephen Few has over 20 years of experience as an IT innovator, consultant, and educator.

                    I wanted to compute 80th term of the Fibonacci series. I wrote the rampant recursive function, 

int fib(int n){ 

return (1==n || 2==n) ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); 

} 

and waited for the result. I wait… and wait… and wait… 

With an 8GB RAM and an Intel i5 CPU, why is it taking so long? I terminated the process and tried computing the 40th term. It took about a second. I put a check and was shocked to find that the above recursive function was called 204,668,309 times while computing the 40th term. 

More than 200 million times? Is it reporting function calls or scam of some government? 

The Dynamic Programming solution computes 100th Fibonacci term in less than fraction of a second, with a single function call, taking linear time and constant extra memory. 

A recursive solution, usually, neither pass all test cases in a coding competition, nor does it impress the interviewer in an interview of company like Google, Microsoft, etc.

                    This book (CS:APP3e) is the third edition of a book that stems from the introductory computer systems course we developed at Carnegie Mellon University, starting in the Fall of 1998, called ""Introduction to Computer Systems"" (ICS). The presentation is based on the following principles, which aim to help the students become better programmers and to help prepare them for upper-level systems courses: 
• Students should be introduced to computer systems from the perspective of a programmer, rather from the more traditional perspective of a system implementer. What does this mean? 
• Students should get a view of the complete system, comprising the hardware, operating system, compiler, and network. 
• Students learn best by developing and evaluating real programs that run on real machines. 
We cover data representations, machine level representations of C programs, processor architecture, program optimizations, the memory hierarchy, linking, exceptional control flow (exceptions, interrupts, processes, and Unix signals), virtual memory and memory management, system-level I/O, basic network programming, and concurrent programming. These concepts are supported by series of fun and hands-on lab assignments. See the manuscript Preface for more details.

                    The award-winning and highly influential Software Architecture in Practice, Third Edition, has been substantially revised to reflect the latest developments in the field. In a real-world setting, the book once again introduces the concepts and best practices of software architecture—how a software system is structured and how that system’s elements are meant to interact. Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organization’s business strategy.
The authors have structured this edition around the concept of architecture influence cycles. Each cycle shows how architecture influences, and is influenced by, a particular context in which architecture plays a critical role. Contexts include technical environment, the life cycle of a project, an organization’s business profile, and the architect’s professional practices. The authors also have greatly expanded their treatment of quality attributes, which remain central to their architecture philosophy—with an entire chapter devoted to each attribute—and broadened their treatment of architectural patterns.
If you design, develop, or manage large software systems (or plan to do so), you will find this book to be a valuable resource for getting up to speed on the state of the art.
Totally new material covers:
• Contexts of software architecture: technical, project, business, and professional

The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles,Noam Nisan,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/a5/db/b5/a5dbb5e7ffbde42b362c27289594f473.jpg,"
A textbook with a hands-on approach that leads students through the gradual construction of a complete and working computer system including the hardware platform and the software hierarchy.In the early days of computer science, the interactions of hardware, software, compilers, and operating system were simple enough to allow students to see an overall picture of how computers worked. With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, The Elements of Computing Systems gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as it comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system.  Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture.  Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience.The book's web site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs for the twelve projects. The projects and systems can be modified to meet various teaching needs, and all the supplied software is open-source.

Building Intelligent Cloud Applications: Develop Scalable Models Using Serverless Architectures with Azure,John Biggs,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/ee/fb/7a/eefb7af8d1749492afc435eec3dba518.jpg,"
                    Serverless computing is radically changing the way we build and deploy applications. With cloud providers running servers and managing machine resources, companies now can focus solely on the application’s business logic and functionality. This hands-on book shows experienced programmers how to build and deploy scalable machine learning and deep learning models using serverless architectures with Microsoft Azure.

You’ll learn step-by-step how to code machine learning into your projects using Python and pre-trained models that include tools such as image recognition, speech recognition, and classification. You’ll also examine issues around deployment and continuous delivery including scaling, security, and monitoring.

This book is divided into four parts:
• Cloud-based development: learn the basics of serverless computing with machine learning, functions as a service (FaaS), and the use of APIs
• Adding intelligence: create serverless applications using Azure Functions; learn how to use pre-built machine-learning and deep-learning models
• Deployment and continuous delivery: get up to speed with Azure Kubernetes Service, as well as Azure Security Center, and Azure Monitoring
• Application examples: deliver data at the edge, build conversational interfaces, and use convolutional neural networks for image classification                ",https://1lib.in/dl/5239560/5e70c4,154,O’Reilly Media,2019,english,"PDF, 9.09 MB"
API Architecture - The Big Picture for Building APIs,Matthias Biehl,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/bb/70/47/bb7047b8073f3697ea1bab047fa211f3.jpg,"
                    Looking for the big picture of building APIs? This book is for you! Building APIs that consumers love should certainly be the goal of any API initiative. However, it is easier said than done. It requires getting the architecture for your APIs right. This book equips you with both foundations and best practices for API architecture. This book is for you if you want to understand the big picture of API design and development, you want to define an API architecture, establish a platform for APIs or simply want to build APIs your consumers love. This book is NOT for you, if you are looking for a step-by step guide for building APIs, focusing on every detail of the correct application of REST principles. In this case I recommend the book ""API Design"" of the API-University Series. What is API architecture? Architecture spans the bigger picture of APIs and can be seen from several perspectives:

    API architecture may refer to the architecture of the complete solution consisting not only of the API itself, but also of an API client such as a mobile app and several other components. API solution architecture explains the components and their relations within the software solution.
    API architecture may refer to the technical architecture of the API platform. When building, running and exposing not only one, but several APIs, it becomes clear that certain building blocks of the API, runtime functionality and management functionality for the API need to be used over and over again. An API platform provides an infrastructure for developing, running and managing APIs.
    API architecture may refer to the architecture of the API portfolio. The API portfolio contains all APIs of the enterprise and needs to be managed like a product. API portfolio architecture analyzes the functionality of the API and organizes, manages and reuses the APIs.
    API architecture may refer to the design decisions for a particular API proxy. To document the design decisions, API description languages are used. We explain the use of API description languages (RAML and Swagger) on many examples.

This book covers all of the above perspectives on API architecture. However, to become useful, the architecture needs to be put into practice. This is why this book covers an API methodology for design and development. An API methodology provides practical guidelines for putting API architecture into practice. It explains how to develop an API architecture into an API that consumers love. A lot of the information on APIs is available on the web. Most of it is published by vendors of API products. I am always a bit suspicious of technical information pushed by product vendors. This book is different. In this book, a product-independent view on API architecture is presented. The API-University Series is a modular series of books on API-related topics. Each book focuses on a particular API topic, so you can select the topics within APIs, which are relevant for you.

                    Apress, 2010 by Rytis SileikaThe scope of the system administrator role has changed dramatically over the years. The number of systems supported by a single engineer has also increased. As such, it is impractical to handcraft each installation, and there is a need to automate as many tasks as possible. The structure of systems varies from organization to organization, therefore system administrators must be able to create their own management tools. Historically, the most popular programming languages for these tasks were UNIX shell and Perl. They served their purpose well, and I doubt they will ever cease to exist. However, the complexity of current systems requires new tools, and the Python programming language is one of them. Python is an object oriented programming language suitable for developing large-scale applications. Its syntax and structure make is very easy to read, so much so that the language is sometimes referred to as executable pseudocode. The Python interpreter allows for interactive execution, so in some situations, you can use it instead of a standard UNIX shell. Although Python is primarily an object-oriented language, you can easily adopt it for procedural and functional styles of programming. Given all that, Python makes a perfect fit as a new language for implementing system administration applications. There are a large number of Linux system utilities already written in Python, such as the Yum package manager and Anaconda, the Linux installation program.This book is about using the Python programming language to solve specific system administration tasks. We will look at the four distinctive system administration areas: network management, web server and web application management, database system management, and system monitoring. Although I will explain most of the technologies used in this book in detail, bear in mind that the main goal of this book is to show you the practical application of the Python libraries to solve rather specific issues. Therefore, I’m assuming that you are a seasoned system administrator. As we go along with the examples, you will be asked to install additional packages and libraries. In most cases, I provide the commands and instructions to perform these tasks on a Fedora system, but you should be ready to adopt these instructions to the Linux distribution that you are going to use. Most of the examples work without many modifications on a recent OS X release (10.6.X) too. I also assume that you have a background in the Python programming language. I will be focusing on introducing the specific libraries that are used in system administration tasks as well as some lesser known or less-often-discussed language functionality, such as the generator functions or the class internal methods, but the basic language syntax is not explained. If you want to refresh your Python skills I would recommend Beginning Python: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition by Magnus Lie Hetland (Apress, 2008). All examples presented in this book assume the Python version 2.6 and will not work correctly with the latest Python 3 without additional modifications. Most of the examples rely on additional modules that have not yet been ported to this version of Python.

Spatial Databases: With Application to GIS (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems),Philippe Rigaux,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/9f/cc/18/9fcc186b22572563ab5cbcc7f17a7660.jpg,"
                    This textbook is an excellent resource for people specifically interested in the theoretical nuts and bolts of spatial databases. The book covers a lot of ground in just over 400 pages. It would be an excellent text for an advanced GIS programming course for either geography students or computer science students. For the geography student, the text provides an excellent coverage of database concepts while drawing on familiar topics. For the computer science student, the book extends basic knowledge of DBMS for spatial applications. The book is divided into eight chapters. Each chapter is completed with an excellent bibliographical review of relevant publications. This review, alone, is worth the price of the book. Chapter 1: Introduction to Spatial Database: Covers basic concepts of SQL, DBMS and spatial data. Chapter 2: Representation of Spatial Objects: This chapter should be familiar to anyone with a GIS background but would fill in the gaps for computer science students. The section on formats and standards is a bit dated but provides a nice theoretical background - especially for the Census TIGER data. Chapter 3: Logical Models and Query Languages: Opposite of Chapter 2, this chapter will challenge the Geography student while further grounding the Computer Science student in GIS data types. Chapter 4: The Constraint Data Model: Here the authors choose to introduce some unique material in the form of the constraint data model. The model is designed specifically to encode spatial data in a basic relational model. The chapter even breaks down the model into relational algebra statements. For most teaching purposes, this chapter can be skipped. Chapter 5: Computational Geometry: An odd gem in a text on spatial databases. This chapter provides a basic introduction to computation geometry techniques and their application to spatial data. One of the most significant aspects of a spatial databases is that it encodes geometric representations of geographic phenomena. Basic computational geometry is a necessary extension for a database to truly support spatial data. Pseudo-code is given but I would recommend the classic Computational Geometry in C (Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science) for detailed implementations. This chapter will be challenging for Geography students but simple for Computer Science students. Chapter 6: Spatial Access Methods: The biggest challenge for spatial databases is spatial indexing - adding a true sense of ""where"" to SELECT...WHERE! The chapter focuses mostly on classical index structures - B-tree, R-Tree, etc. This would be a good chapter for a ""short week"" as it is either a research focus or matter of ""it just works"". Students who desire to research spatial indexing will find the chapter lacking. Others will find it overwhelming. Chapter 7: Query Processing: Like Chapter 6, this chapter delves into details that only a student truly interested in researching spatial indexes or developing new databases would be concerned with. The chapter presents how the spatial index is utilized for joins and relates. Chapter 8: Commercial Systems: Any book that attempts to survey existing software is always out of date. This chapter might be of historical interest but is hardly worth covering. The section of PostgreSQL is interesting but better material exists on the web. Overall, the book is well written and clearly presents the material. The coverage is focused on applications to spatial databases. My favorite advanced GIS textbook is GIS: A Computing Perspective, Second Edition.

Joe Celko's Data and Databases: Concepts in Practice (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems),Joe Celko,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/96/c2/18/96c218b3bc9f1779f735f5180eaee0e1.jpg,"
Do you need an introductory book on data and databases? If the book is by Joe Celko, the answer is yes. Data and Databases: Concepts in Practice is the first introduction to relational database technology written especially for practicing IT professionals. If you work mostly outside the database world, this book will ground you in the concepts and overall framework you must master if your data-intensive projects are to be successful. If you're already an experienced database programmer, administrator, analyst, or user, it will let you take a step back from your work and examine the founding principles on which you rely every day-helping you to work smarter, faster, and problem-free.
Whatever your field or level of expertise, Data and Databases offers you the depth and breadth of vision for which Celko is famous. No one knows the topic as well as he, and no one conveys this knowledge as clearly, as effectively-or as engagingly. Filled with absorbing war stories and no-holds-barred commentary, this is a book you'll pick up again and again, both for the information it holds and for the distinctive style that marks it as genuine Celko.

                    I am a proud owner of Visio for Enterprise Architects, the only case tool I own, and I've have also purchased and used T.Halpins text regarding the use if this tool. In this text, Terry goes thru great efforts to promote the use of object role modeling, ORM, in conceptual designs. I am somewhat sceptical about why there no other book or author using ORM in their explanations of conceptual designs. I whish I had $5k to purchase a copy of ERwin so I could be in the main stream.
I also contacted Microsoft and asked if they were enhancing Visio for Enterprise Architects in Visual Studio 2005. They told me that it will still ship with it but that there are no changes to accommodate SQL Server 2005.

 Numerical Methods provides a clear and concise exploration of standard numerical analysis topics, as well as nontraditional ones, including mathematical modeling, Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, and fractals. Filled with appealing examples that will motivate students, the textbook considers modern application areas, such as information retrieval and animation, and classical topics from physics and engineering. Exercises use MATLAB and promote understanding of computational results.  The book gives instructors the flexibility to emphasize different aspects--design, analysis, or computer implementation--of numerical algorithms, depending on the background and interests of students. Designed for upper-division undergraduates in mathematics or computer science classes, the textbook assumes that students have prior knowledge of linear algebra and calculus, although these topics are reviewed in the text. Short discussions of the history of numerical methods are interspersed throughout the chapters. The book also includes polynomial interpolation at Chebyshev points, use of the MATLAB package Chebfun, and a section on the fast Fourier transform. Supplementary materials are available online.

Networks play a central role in today’s society, since many sectors employing information technology, such as communication, mobility, and transport - even social interactions and political activities - are based on and rely on networks. In these times of globalization and the current global financial crisis with its complex and nearly incomprehensible entanglements of various structures and its huge effect on seemingly unrelated institutions and organizations, the need to understand large networks, their complex structures, and the processes governing them is becoming more and more important.This state-of-the-art survey reports on the progress made in selected areas of this important and growing field, thus helping to analyze existing large and complex networks and to design new and more efficient algorithms for solving various problems on these networks since many of them have become so large and complex that classical algorithms are not sufficient anymore. This volume emerged from a research program funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) consisting of projects focusing on the design of new discrete algorithms for large and complex networks. The 18 papers included in the volume present the results of projects realized within the program and survey related work. They have been grouped into four parts: network algorithms, traffic networks, communication networks, and network analysis and simulation.

The second section covers the algorithmic design techniques of divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming, branch and bound, and graph traversal. For each of these techniques, the book presents templates and guidelines on when to use and not to use each technique. The third major section of the book covers NP-completeness and the inherent hardness of problems. Using the material provided in this book, students and professionals can master the processes to use in solving the most difficult algorithmic problems. Users can explore various techniques, and learn to decide which algorithm design technique to use for a given problem.

Design and Analysis of Randomized Algorithms: Introduction to Design Paradigms,Juraj Hromkovič,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/a0/84/4b/a0844b3b2dc499d663c7d3d7da1922c3.jpg,"
                    Randomness is a powerful phenomenon that can be harnessed to solve various problems in all areas of computer science. Randomized algorithms are often more efficient, simpler and, surprisingly, also more reliable than their deterministic counterparts. Computing tasks exist that require billions of years of computer work when solved using the fastest known deterministic algorithms, but they can be solved using randomized algorithms in a few minutes with negligible error probabilities.

Introducing the fascinating world of randomness, this book systematically teaches the main algorithm design paradigms – foiling an adversary, abundance of witnesses, fingerprinting, amplification, and random sampling, etc. – while also providing a deep insight into the nature of success in randomization. Taking sufficient time to present motivations and to develop the reader's intuition, while being rigorous throughout, this text is a very effective and efficient introduction to this exciting field.

Linux is a free and freely distributed operating system inspired by the UNIX system, written by Linus Torvalds with the help of thousands of programmers.



Unlike other operating systems, such as MacOS (Apple operating system), UNIX is not intended to be easy to use, but to be extremely flexible. It is generally as easy to use as other operating systems, although great efforts are being made to facilitate its use. 



This operating system is an option to be taken into account by those users who are dedicated to work through networks, devote to programming, or learn hacking techniques.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/5445273/4cbbbf,530,Unknown,2020,english,"EPUB, 2.96 MB"

 Software Engineering at Google,Hyrum Wright,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/03/2e/e6/032ee62576302e880c39607600b19582.png,"
How do you manage a living codebase that evolves and responds to changing requirements and demands over the length of its life? Based on their experience at Google, software engineers Titus Winters and Hyrum K. Wright, along with technical writer Tom Manshreck, present a candid and insightful look at how some of the world’s leading practitioners construct and maintain software.
At Google, software engineering represents roughly 80-90% of the work, while only 10-20% of the time involves original programming. Most teaching on this subject concentrates on programming, but little on software engineering. By emphasizing three fundamental principles that software organizations should keep in mind when designing, architecting, and writing code, this book explains:
  * Fundamental differences between software engineering and programming
  * The software engineering lifecycle from code development to testing to deprecation
  * How to effectively manage your codebase and efficiently respond to change
  * Why culture is important, and how processes, practices, and tools come into play
  * Tradeoffs: how an organization makes optimal software decisions by keeping time and scale in mind

Book Description
Software Engineering is about more than just writing code―it includes a host of soft skills that apply to almost any development effort, no matter what the language, development methodology, or scope of the project. Being a senior developer all but requires awareness of how those skills, along with their expected technical counterparts, mesh together through a project's life cycle. This book walks you through that discovery by going over the entire life cycle of a multi-tier system and its related software projects. You'll see what happens before any development takes place, and what impact the decisions and designs made at each step have on the development process. The development of the entire project, over the course of several iterations based on real-world Agile iterations, will be executed, sometimes starting from nothing, in one of the fastest growing languages in the world―Python. Application of practices in Python will be laid out, along with a number of Python-specific capabilities that are often overlooked. Finally, the book will implement a high-performance computing solution, from first principles through complete foundation.

What you will learn
• Understand what happens over the course of a system's life (SDLC)
• Establish what to expect from the pre-development life cycle steps
• Find out how the development-specific phases of the SDLC affect development
• Uncover what a real-world development process might be like, in an Agile way
• Find out how to do more than just write the code
• Identify the existence of project-independent best practices and how to use them
• Find out how to design and implement a high-performance computing process

Software Engineering: Architecture-driven Software Development is the first comprehensive guide to the underlying skills embodied in the IEEE's Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) standard. Standards expert Richard Schmidt explains the traditional software engineering practices recognized for developing projects for government or corporate systems.  Software engineering education often lacks standardization, with many institutions focusing on implementation rather than design as it impacts product architecture. Many graduates join the workforce with incomplete skills, leading to software projects that either fail outright or run woefully over budget and behind schedule.  Additionally, software engineers need to understand system engineering and architecture-the hardware and peripherals their programs will run on. This issue will only grow in importance as more programs leverage parallel computing, requiring an understanding of the parallel capabilities of processors and hardware. This book gives both software developers and system engineers key insights into how their skillsets support and complement each other. With a focus on these key knowledge areas, Software Engineering offers a set of best practices that can be applied to any industry or domain involved in developing software products.A thorough, integrated compilation on the engineering of software products, addressing the majority of the standard knowledge areas and topics Offers best practices focused on those key skills common to many industries and domains that develop software Learn how software engineering relates to systems engineering for better communication with other engineering professionals within a project environment ",https://1lib.in/dl/2190533/646279,376,Morgan Kaufmann,2013,english,"PDF, 11.97 MB"

                    I am forced here to eco the thoughts and feelings of several other reviewers here, ""what can you say? It's Poe.""  To do  a critical analysis of this work, in particular by a non-Poe scholar such is myself, would be the height of arrogance on my part; pontificating on a subject of which so many, many others are more qualified would come across as, well...pompous and in many ways laughable.  I seriously doubt if I could come up with bits of criticism or accolades others have not been hammering away at for the past one hundred years or so.   Poe though is one of my favorite short story authors and indeed, one of my favorite poets.  I have been reading him for well over fifty years now and his work is as bright and fresh to me now as when it was first read to me as a child.  There are a few things to note though, and a couple of comments the reader needs to be aware of concerning this particular edition. First, this work has not been annotated nor has it been translated (French).  I note that on this site and several others that this has thrown some into a hissy fit state.  Good grief!  This lack of translation does not distract from the story a bit.  In addition, with the most simplest of computers it only takes a snap or two on the mouse to come up with the translation of not only French, but just about any other language  you might come across...stop being so lazy!  Having to research it yourself is the best way to learn!  If you have problems understanding what he is writing of; again, there are literally thousands of sites that would love a visit from you...many of them are quite good! No computer?  Not problem!  They actually have books at your local library with the same information in them! Secondly, I have noted that on this site and several others that there seems to be a bit of whining about Poe's vocabulary, i.e. he uses ""big words.""  Folks, if you read 90 percent of the popular fiction books being cranked out today and pay very, very close attention, you will find that they have been dumbed down.  They are ALL written at a 7th or 8th grade level!  If you must use a dictionary a bit (which I fully and proudly admit to being forced to use each time I read Poe), then so much the better!  Learning a new word and its usage is actually a good thing! I promise you that you will not suffer any permanent physical or mental damage.  Thirdly, I note that on this site and several others it has been mentioned, and again whine about the fact that Poe tends to use a prose style that is no longer is use.  Good grief.  I suppose we should have his entire works purged of such and bring it all up to date...Hey Reader's Digest...you are falling down on the job! You are missing out on the chance to befoul yet another masterful bit of writing!  This of all the complaints has to be the most asinine. I almost have to cry when I read such gibberish, yet at the same time feel a certain degree of pity for those that make such statements.  Fourthly, it should be noted that Poe is actually the Great Grand Daddy of the detective novel or short story and was at least a generation ahead of Doyle.  There are some great detective stories in his body of work and should not be missed my any lover of this genre. Fifthly, it may come as a shock to some, but Poe did write more than just ""The Raven."" If you have not read Poe...you should.  If it has been years since you visited him...get off your duff and set down with a cup of tea, and your pipe, if so inclined to participate in that nasty habit, and do some rediscovering.  If you are in school, i.e. of the younger set, read him.  I promise you will learn much of writing, story telling, emotions and actually yourself.   Do yourself a big time favor and get a copy of this particular edition, or any other edition for that matter, and get reacquainted with this genius. Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks                ",https://1lib.in/dl/647095/2e0900,1057,Doubleday,1966,english,"PDF, 4.39 MB"

Today, microcontrollers, or single integrated circuit (chip) computers, play critical roles in almost all instrumentation and control systems. Most existing books arewritten for undergraduate and graduate students taking an electrical and/or computer engineering course. Furthermore, these texts have beenwritten with a particular model of microcontroller as the target discussion. These textbooks also require a requisite knowledge of digital design fundamentals. This textbook presents the fundamental concepts common to all microcontrollers. Our goals are to present the over–arching theory of microcontroller operation and to provide a detailed discussion on constituent subsystems available in most microcontrollers. With such goals, we envision that the theory discussed in this book can be readily applied to a wide variety of microcontroller technologies, allowing practicing scientists and engineers to become acquainted with basic concepts prior to beginning a design involving a specific microcontroller. We have found that the fundamental principles of a given microcontroller are easily transferred to other controllers.

There are several introductory textbooks on computational chemistry; this one is (as in its previous editions) a unique textbook in the field with copious exercises (and questions) and solutions with discussions. Noteworthy is the fact that it is the only book at the introductory level that shows in detail yet clearly how matrices are used in one important aspect of computational chemistry. It also serves as an essential guide for researchers, and as a reference book. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2802713/13c438,739,Springer International Publishing,2016,english,"PDF, 13.78 MB"

What Can Be Computed?: A Practical Guide to the Theory of Computation,John MacCormick,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/7b/9c/51/7b9c51fe0080fe233189df1a9fdbe717.jpg,"
                    An accessible and rigorous textbook for introducing undergraduates to computer science theory

What Can Be Computed? is a uniquely accessible yet rigorous introduction to the most profound ideas at the heart of computer science. Crafted specifically for undergraduates who are studying the subject for the first time, and requiring minimal prerequisites, the book focuses on the essential fundamentals of computer science theory and features a practical approach that uses real computer programs (Python and Java) and encourages active experimentation. It is also ideal for self-study and reference.

The book covers the standard topics in the theory of computation, including Turing machines and finite automata, universal computation, nondeterminism, Turing and Karp reductions, undecidability, time-complexity classes such as P and NP, and NP-completeness, including the Cook-Levin Theorem. But the book also provides a broader view of computer science and its historical development, with discussions of Turing's original 1936 computing machines, the connections between undecidability and Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and Karp's famous set of twenty-one NP-complete problems.

Throughout, the book recasts traditional computer science concepts by considering how computer programs are used to solve real problems. Standard theorems are stated and proven with full mathematical rigor, but motivation and understanding are enhanced by considering concrete implementations. The book's examples and other content allow readers to view demonstrations of―and to experiment with―a wide selection of the topics it covers. The result is an ideal text for an introduction to the theory of computation.

                    Financial Risk Forecasting is a complete introduction to practical quantitative risk management, with a focus on market risk. Derived from the authors teaching notes and years spent training practitioners in risk management techniques, it brings together the three key disciplines of finance, statistics and modeling (programming), to provide a thorough grounding in risk management techniques.Written by renowned risk expert Jon Danielsson, the book begins with an introduction to financial markets and market prices, volatility clusters, fat tails and nonlinear dependence. It then goes on to present volatility forecasting with both univatiate and multivatiate methods, discussing the various methods used by industry, with a special focus on the GARCH family of models. The evaluation of the quality of forecasts is discussed in detail. Next, the main concepts in risk and models to forecast risk are discussed, especially volatility, value-at-risk and expected shortfall. The focus is both on risk in basic assets such as stocks and foreign exchange, but also calculations of risk in bonds and options, with analytical methods such as delta-normal VaR and duration-normal VaR and Monte Carlo simulation. The book then moves on to the evaluation of risk models with methods like backtesting, followed by a discussion on stress testing. The book concludes by focussing on the forecasting of risk in very large and uncommon events with extreme value theory and considering the underlying assumptions behind almost every risk model in practical use – that risk is exogenous – and what happens when those assumptions are violated.Every method presented brings together theoretical discussion and derivation of key equations and a discussion of issues in practical implementation. Each method is implemented in both MATLAB and R, two of the most commonly used mathematical programming languages for risk forecasting with which the reader can implement the models illustrated in the book.The book includes four appendices. The first introduces basic concepts in statistics and financial time series referred to throughout the book. The second and third introduce R and MATLAB, providing a discussion of the basic implementation of the software packages. And the final looks at the concept of maximum likelihood, especially issues in implementation and testing.The book is accompanied by a website - www.financialriskforecasting.com – which features downloadable code as used in the book.

                    This book is intended to provide an account of those parts of contemporary set theory that are relevant to other areas of pure mathematics. Intended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students, the text is written in an easy-going style, with a minimum of formalism. The book begins with a review of ""naive"" set theory; it then develops the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of the theory, showing how they arise naturally from a rigorous answer to the question, ""what is a set?"" After discussing the ordinal and cardinal numbers, the book then delves into contemporary set theory, covering such topics as: the Borel hierarchy, stationary sets and regressive functions, and Lebesgue measure. Two chapters present an extension of the Zermelo-Fraenkel theory, discussing the axiom of constructibility and the question of provability in set theory. A final chapter presents an account of an alternative conception of set theory that has proved useful in computer science, the non-well-founded set theory of Peter Aczel. The author is a well-known mathematician and the editor of the ""Computers in Mathematics"" column in the AMS Notices and of FOCUS, the magazine published by the MAA.

                    Covering the breadth of a large topic, this book provides a thorough grounding in object-oriented concepts, the software development process, UML and multi-tier technologies.   After covering some basic ground work underpinning OO software projects, the book follows the steps of a typical development project (Requirements Capture - Design - Specification & Test), showing how an abstract problem is taken through to a concrete solution. The book is programming language agnostic - so code is kept to a minimum to avoid detail and deviation into implementation minutiae.A single case study running through the text provides a realistic example showing development from an initial proposal through to a finished system. Key artifacts such as the requirements document and detailed designs are included. For each aspect of the case study, there is an exercise for the reader to produce similar documents for a different system.

Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) has over the years, become a vast field, encompassing such diverse topics as design process and principles, documentation tools, refactoring, and design and architectural patterns. For most students the learning experience is incomplete without implementation. This new textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to OOAD. The salient points of its coverage are: • A sound footing on object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic linking, etc. • A good introduction to the stage of requirements analysis. • Use of UML to document user requirements and design. • An extensive treatment of the design process. • Coverage of implementation issues. • Appropriate use of design and architectural patterns. • Introduction to the art and craft of refactoring. • Pointers to resources that further the reader’s knowledge. All the main case-studies used for this book have been implemented by the authors using Java. The text is liberally peppered with snippets of code, which are short and fairly self-explanatory and easy to read. Familiarity with a Java-like syntax and a broad understanding of the structure of Java would be helpful in using the book to its full potential.

How the Internet Happened: From Netscape to the iPhone,Brian McCullough,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/5e/58/2c/5e582cd3a8b8dd9d9f4c60a0f2f5e453.jpg,"
                    Tech-guru Brian McCullough delivers a rollicking history of the internet, why it exploded, and how it changed everything.

The internet was never intended for you, opines Brian McCullough in this lively narrative of an era that utterly transformed everything we thought we knew about technology. In How the Internet Happened, he chronicles the whole fascinating story for the first time, beginning in a dusty Illinois basement in 1993, when a group of college kids set off a once-in-an-epoch revolution with what would become the first “dotcom.”

Depicting the lives of now-famous innovators like Netscape’s Marc Andreessen and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, McCullough also reveals surprising quirks and unknown tales as he tracks both the technology and the culture around the internet’s rise. Cinematic in detail and unprecedented in scope, the result both enlightens and informs as it draws back the curtain on the new rhythm of disruption and innovation the internet fostered, and helps to redefine an era that changed every part of our lives.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY, AND WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLERDr. Kai-Fu Lee—one of the world’s most respected experts on AI and China—reveals that China has suddenly caught up to the US at an astonishingly rapid and unexpected pace.  In AI Superpowers, Kai-fu Lee argues powerfully that because of these unprecedented developments in AI, dramatic changes will be happening much sooner than many of us expected. Indeed, as the US-Sino AI competition begins to heat up, Lee urges the US and China to both accept and to embrace the great responsibilities that come with significant technological power. Most experts already say that AI will have a devastating impact on blue-collar jobs. But Lee predicts that Chinese and American AI will have a strong impact on white-collar jobs as well. Is universal basic income the solution? In Lee’s opinion, probably not.  But he provides  a clear description of which jobs will be affected and how soon, which jobs can be enhanced with AI, and most importantly, how we can provide solutions to some of the most profound changes in human history that are coming soon.

Science world luminary John Brockman assembles twenty-five of the most important scientific minds, people who have been thinking about the field artificial intelligence for most of their careers, for an unparalleled round-table examination about mind, thinking, intelligence and what it means to be human.""Artificial intelligence is today's story--the story behind all other stories. It is the Second Coming and the Apocalypse at the same time: Good AI versus evil AI.""--John BrockmanMore than sixty years ago, mathematician-philosopher Norbert Wiener published a book on the place of machines in society that ended with a warning: ""we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions.... The hour is very late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door.""In the wake of advances in unsupervised, self-improving machine learning, a small but influential community of thinkers is considering Wiener's words again. InPossible Minds, John Brockman gathers their disparate visions of where AI might be taking us.The fruit of the long history of Brockman's profound engagement with the most important scientific minds who have been thinking about AI--from Alison Gopnik and David Deutsch to Frank Wilczek and Stephen Wolfram--Possible Mindsis an ideal introduction to the landscape of crucial issues AI presents. The collision between opposing perspectives is salutary and exhilarating; some of these figures, such as computer scientist Stuart Russell, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and physicist Max Tegmark, are deeply concerned with the threat of AI, including the existential one, while others, notably robotics entrepreneur Rodney Brooks, philosopher Daniel Dennett, and bestselling author Steven Pinker, have a very different view.

On the Eve of the AI era, it is perfect timing to read an AI expert's autobiography, to learn about Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, the author of ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley & the New World,"". This is the first and only authorized English version of Dr. Lee's autobiography. The original Chinese version of the sold 1.2 million copies in China in 2009 as a best seller of the year over there. Evidently, this autobiography is full of spellbinding stories.A natural-born pioneer, Dr. Lee has explored uncharted territories and developed new fields in the high-tech world. In addition, his Chinese American background has enabled him to effectively bridge corporate America with the China market. He recounts all his career experiences with Apple, Microsoft, and Google as well as his own technological achievements in this amazing autobiography.Dr. Lee was once the focus of a media sensation in 2005 when Microsoft and Google fought over him in court. He shocked the media again in 2009 by resigning from the position of Google China's president. There have been many speculations about the two incidents, behind which some insider stories are exclusively told in this book.The autobiography depicts not only Dr. Lee but also several prominent high-tech leaders he has worked with in the past two decades. It gets up close and personal with Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Eric Schmidt, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It contains their anecdotes hardly ever known to the general public.

The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work,Thomas H. Davenport,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/1a/c4/fa/1ac4faaa797aa0ab5d2afdfc361d7841.jpg,"
                    In The AI Advantage, Thomas Davenport offers a guide to using artificial intelligence in business. He describes what technologies are available and how companies can use them for business benefits and competitive advantage. He cuts through the hype of the AI craze—remember when it seemed plausible that IBM’s Watson could cure cancer?—to explain how businesses can put artificial intelligence to work now, in the real world. His key recommendation: don’t go for the “moonshot” (curing cancer, or synthesizing all investment knowledge); look for the “low-hanging fruit” to make your company more efficient.
Davenport explains that the business value AI offers is solid rather than sexy or splashy. AI will improve products and processes and make decisions better informed—important but largely invisible tasks. AI technologies won’t replace human workers but augment their capabilities, with smart machines to work alongside smart people. AI can automate structured and repetitive work; provide extensive analysis of data through machine learning (“analytics on steroids”), and engage with customers and employees via chatbots and intelligent agents. Companies should experiment with these technologies and develop their own expertise.
Davenport describes the major AI technologies and explains how they are being used, reports on the AI work done by large commercial enterprises like Amazon  and Google, and outlines strategies and steps to becoming a cognitive corporation. This book provides an invaluable guide to the real-world future of business AI.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/3611127/8bf1ec,248,Mit Press,2018,english,"PDF, 7.63 MB"

The second edition of this textbook has been fully revised and adds material about loop optimisation, function call optimisation and dataflow analysis. It presents techniques for making realistic compilers for simple programming languages, using techniques that are close to those used in ""real"" compilers, albeit in places slightly simplified for presentation purposes. All phases required for translating a high-level language to symbolic machine language are covered, including lexing, parsing, type checking, intermediate-code generation, machine-code generation, register allocation and optimisation, interpretation is covered briefly. Aiming to be neutral with respect to implementation languages, algorithms are presented in pseudo-code rather than in any specific programming language, but suggestions are in many cases given for how these can be realised in different language flavours.Introduction to Compiler Design is intended for an introductory course in compiler design, suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses depending on which chapters are used.

While compilers for high-level programming languages are large complex software systems, they have particular characteristics that differentiate them from other software systems. Their functionality is almost completely well-defined - ideally there exist complete precise descriptions of the source and target languages. Additional descriptions of the interfaces to the operating system, programming system and programming environment, and to other compilers and libraries are often available. The book deals with the optimization phase of compilers. In this phase, programs are transformed in order to increase their efficiency. To preserve the semantics of the programs in these transformations, the compiler has to meet the associated applicability conditions. These are checked using static analysis of the programs. In this book the authors systematically describe the analysis and transformation of imperative and functional programs. In addition to a detailed description of important efficiency-improving transformations, the book offers a concise introduction to the necessary concepts and methods, namely to operational semantics, lattices, and fixed-point algorithms.This book is intended for students of computer science. The book is supported throughout with examples, exercises and program fragments. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2065903/476d31,177,Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg,2012,english,"PDF, 1.02 MB"

                    Developing reliable, scalable distributed systems today is often more black art than science. Building these systems is complicated and, because few formally established patterns are available for designing them, most of these systems end up looking very unique. This practical guide shows you how to use existing software design patterns for designing and building reliable distributed applications.Although patterns such as those developed more than 20 years ago by the Gang of Four were largely restricted to running on single machines, author Brendan Burns--a Partner Architect in Microsoft Azure--demonstrates how you can reuse several of them in modern distributed applications.Systems engineers and application developers will learn how these patterns provide a common language and framework for dramatically increasing the quality of your system.

                    Implementing the automation of electric distribution networks, from simple remote control to the application of software-based decision tools, requires many considerations, such as assessing costs, selecting the control infrastructure type and automation level, deciding on the ambition level, and justifying the solution through a business case. Control and Automation of Electric Power Distribution Systems addresses all of these issues to aid you in resolving automation problems and improving the management of your distribution network.
Bringing together automation concepts as they apply to utility distribution systems, this volume presents the theoretical and practical details of a control and automation solution for the entire distribution system of substations and feeders. The fundamentals of this solution include depth of control, boundaries of control responsibility, stages of automation, automation intensity levels, and automated device preparedness. To meet specific performance goals, the authors discuss distribution planning, performance calculations, and protection to facilitate the selection of the primary device, associated secondary control, and fault indicators. The book also provides two case studies that illustrate the business case for distribution automation (DA) and methods for calculating benefits, including the assessment of crew time savings.
As utilities strive for better economies, DA, along with other tools described in this volume, help to achieve improved management of the distribution network. Using Control and Automation of Electric Power Distribution Systems, you can embark on the automation solution best suited for your needs.

This third edition of a classic textbook can be used to teach at the senior undergraduate and graduate levels. The material concentrates on fundamental theories as well as techniques and algorithms. The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and, more recently, the emergence of cloud computing and streaming data applications, has forced a renewal of interest in distributed and parallel data management, while, at the same time, requiring a rethinking of some of the traditional techniques. This book covers the breadth and depth of this re-emerging field. The coverage consists of two parts. The first part discusses the fundamental principles of distributed data management and includes distribution design, data integration, distributed query processing and optimization, distributed transaction management, and replication. The second part focuses on more advanced topics and includes discussion of parallel database systems, distributed object management, peer-to-peer data management, web data management, data stream systems, and cloud computing. New in this Edition: • New chapters, covering database replication, database integration, multidatabase query processing, peer-to-peer data management, and web data management. • Coverage of emerging topics such as data streams and cloud computing • Extensive revisions and updates based on years of class testing and feedback Ancillary teaching materials are available.

Programming distributed computing systems: a foundational approach,Varela C.A.,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/ee/1d/22/ee1d222bab0953ae7d3b05a91d883d91.jpg,"
Starting from the premise that understanding the foundations of concurrent programming is key to developing distributed computing systems, this book first presents the fundamental theories of concurrent computing and then introduces the programming languages that help develop distributed computing systems at a high level of abstraction. The major theories of concurrent computation -- including the p-calculus, the actor model, the join calculus, and mobile ambients -- are explained with a focus on how they help design and reason about distributed and mobile computing systems. The book then presents programming languages that follow the theoretical models already described, including Pict, SALSA, and JoCaml. The parallel structure of the chapters in both part one (theory) and part two (practice) enable the reader not only to compare the different theories but also to see clearly how a programming language supports a theoretical model. The book is unique in bridging the gap between the theory and the practice of programming distributed computing systems. It can be used as a textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in computer science or as a reference for researchers in the area of programming technology for distributed computing. By presenting theory first, the book allows readers to focus on the essential components of concurrency, distribution, and mobility without getting bogged down in syntactic details of specific programming languages. Once the theory is understood, the practical part of implementing a system in an actual programming language becomes much easier.

                    InTech, 2012. — 390 p.We live in an era of unimaginably rapidly advancing and amazing technologies that enable instantaneous flow of information – anytime, anywhere. The convergence of computers and networks has been the key force behind the development of these awesome technologies. Increasing use of systems which are built using advanced information technologies is having a profound impact on our everyday lives. These technologies are becoming all pervasive and ubiquitous.With the exponential growth of wireless telecommunication and information technologies and the increasingly dominant roles played by electronic commerce in every major industry, safeguarding of information travelling over the communication networks is increasingly becoming one of the most important and contentious challenges for the technology innovators. The key prerequisite for the continued development and successful exploitation of information technology and other related industries is the notion of information assurance that includes operations for protecting and defending information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and information confidentiality and privacy.In this age of electronic connectivity, of viruses and hackers, of electronic eavesdropping and electronic fraud, network security has assumed increasing importance. Two trends are emerging very clearly in this regard. First, the explosive growth in computer systems and their interconnections via networks has increased the dependence of both organizations and individuals on the information stored and communicated using these systems. This, in turn, has led to a heightened awareness of the need to protect data and resources from disclosure, to guarantee the authenticity of data and messages, and to protect systems from network-based attacks. Second, the disciplines of cryptography and network security have matured, leading to the development of practical, readily available applications to enforce network security. Cryptography will continue to play lead roles in developing new security solutions which will be in great demand with the advent of high-speed next-generation communication systems and networks. New cryptographic algorithms, protocols and tools must follow up in order to adapt to the new communication and computing technologies. Computing systems and communication protocols like IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15 are increasingly becoming targets of attacks since the underlying radio communication medium for wireless networks provides serious security loopholes. New security mechanisms should be designed to defend against the increasingly complex and sophisticated attacks launched on networks and web-based applications. In addition to classical cryptographic algorithms, new approaches like chaos-based cryptography, DNA-based cryptography and quantum cryptography will be play important roles.The purpose of this book is to present some of the critical security challenges in today’s communication networks and computing and to provide insights to possible mechanisms to defend against attacks. With this objective, the book provides a collection of research work in the field of cryptography and network security by some experts in these areas. The book contains 16 chapters which are divided into three parts. The chapters in Part 1 of the book largely deal with security and privacy issues in computing and communication networks. The Part 2 includes chapters which are related to the field of quantum cryptography. The chapters dealing with the evolutionary concepts of cryptography and their applications like chaos-based cryptography and DNA cryptography are included in the Part 3 of the book.

                    As the use of wireless devices becomes widespread, so does the need for strong and secure transport protocols. Even with this intensified need for securing systems, using cryptography does not seem to be a viable solution due to difficulties in implementation. The security layers of many wireless protocols use outdated encryption algorithms, which have proven unsuitable for hardware usage, particularly with handheld devices.   Summarizing key issues involved in achieving desirable performance in security implementations, Wireless Security and Cryptography: Specifications and Implementations focuses on alternative integration approaches for wireless communication security. It gives an overview of the current security layer of wireless protocols and presents the performance characteristics of implementations in both software and hardware. This resource also presents efficient and novel methods to execute security schemes in wireless protocols with high performance.
