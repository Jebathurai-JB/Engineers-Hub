Design of Embedded Robust Control Systems Using MATLAB®/Simulink®,Petko Hristov Petkov,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/5f/4a/d0/5f4ad0a074ee211b356373e765a2c8ba.jpg,"
                    This book explores the implementation of MATLAB(R) and Simulink(R) in the development of embedded robust control systems. Robust control theory allows for changes in a system whilst maintaining stability and performance. Applications of this technique are very important for dependable embedded systems, making technologies such as drones and other autonomous systems with sophisticated embedded controllers and systems relatively common-place.Three extended case studies are developed in depth: embedded control of a tank physical model; robust control of a miniature helicopter; and robust control of two-wheeled robots. These are taken from the area of motion control but the book may be also used by designers in other areas.Some knowledge of linear control theory is assumed and experience of C programming is desirable but to make the book accessible to engineers new to the field and to students, the authors avoid complicated mathematical proofs and overwhelming computer architecture technical details. All programs used in the examples and case studies will be freely downloadable to help with the assimilation of the book contents.This book is essential reading for engineers, developers, designers, industrial practitioners, scientists, and researchers in Control, Automation, Robotics, Mechatronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computing, and Electronics (with a focus on robust control systems and the design, modelling and implementation of embedded systems).

                    Much has been written about the need to revitalize control education. This book addresses the problem by providing a refreshing new approach to teaching control system design. The book strongly emphasizes real-world design, making it appropriate for the first-time learner as well as for engineers in industry as a technology refresher. The book has been used by the authors for both undergraduate and graduate courses at several universities. The authors' experience is split evenly between academia and industry, which is reflected in the contents of the book. It is divided into 8 parts covering essential aspects in control, ranging from signals and systems (Bode diagrams, root locus, etc.), to SISO control (including PID and fundamental design tradeoffs), and MIMO systems (including constraints, MPC, decoupling, etc.).A key aspect of the book is the frequent use of real world design examples drawn directly from the authors' industrial experience. These are represented by over 15 substantial case studies ranging from distillation columns to satellite tracking. The book is also liberally supported by modern teaching aids available on both an accompanying CD-ROM and Companion Website. Resources to be found there include MATLABR routines for all examples; extensive PowerPoint lecture notes based on the book; and a totally unique Java Applet-driven ""virtual laboratory"" that allows readers to interact with the real-world case studies.

This file may be corrupted!A complete toolkit for teaching, learning, and understanding the essential concepts of automatic control systemsEdition after acclaimed edition, Automatic Control Systems has delivered up-to-date, real-world coverage designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of control systems. More than a comprehensive text, Automatic Control Systems includes innovative virtual labs that replicate physical systems and sharpen readers’ problem-solving skills.The Tenth Edition introduces the concept of Control Lab, which includes two classes of experiments: SIMLab (model-based simulation) and LEGOLab (physical experiments using LEGO® robots). These experiments are intended to supplement, or replace, the experimental exposure of the students in a traditional undergraduate control course and will allow these students to do their work within the MATLAB® and Simulink® environment—even at home. This cost-effective approach may allow educational institutions to equip their labs with a number of LEGO test beds and maximize student access to the equipment at a fraction of the cost of currently available control system experiments. Alternatively, as a supplemental learning tool, students can take the equipment home and learn at their own pace.This new edition continues a tradition of excellence with:• A greater number of solved examples  • Online labs using both LEGO MINDSTORMS® and MATLAB/SIMLab  • Enhancements to the easy-to-use MATLAB GUI software (ACSYS) to allow interface with LEGO MINDSTORMS  • A valuable introduction to the concept of Control Lab  • A logical organization, with Chapters 1 to 3 covering all background material and Chapters 4 to 11 presenting material directly related to the subject of control  • 10 online appendices, including Elementary Matrix Theory and Algebra, Control Lab, Difference Equations, and Mathematical Foundation  • A full-set of PowerPoint® slides and solutions available to instructorsAdopted by hundreds of universities and translated into at least nine languages, Automatic Control Systems remains the single-best resource for students to gain a practical understanding of the subject and to prepare them for the challenges they will one day face. For practicing engineers, it represents a clear, thorough, and current self-study resource that they will turn to again and again throughout their career.LEGO and MINDSTORMS are registered trademarks of the LEGO GroupMATLAB and Simulink are registered trademarks of The MathWorks, Inc.

                    At publication, The Control Handbook immediately became the definitive resource that engineers working with modern control systems required. Among its many accolades, that first edition was cited by the AAP as the Best Engineering Handbook of 1996.     Now, 15 years later, William Levine has once again compiled the most comprehensive and authoritative resource on control engineering. He has fully reorganized the text to reflect the technical advances achieved since the last edition and has expanded its contents to include the multidisciplinary perspective that is making control engineering a critical component in so many fields.    Now expanded from one to three volumes, The Control Handbook, Second Edition organizes cutting-edge contributions from more than 200 leading experts. The second volume, Control System Applications, includes 35 entirely new applications organized by subject area. Covering the design and use of control systems, this volume includes applications for:        Automobiles, including PEM fuel cells  Aerospace  Industrial control of machines and processes  Biomedical uses, including robotic surgery and drug discovery and development  Electronics and communication networks      Other applications are included in a section that reflects the multidisciplinary nature of control system work. These include applications for the construction of financial portfolios, earthquake response control for civil structures, quantum estimation and control, and the modeling and control of air conditioning and refrigeration systems.    As with the first edition, the new edition not only stands as a record of accomplishment in control engineering but provides researchers with the means to make further advances.

                    This book is pretty good, provided you have an adequate grasp of the background information.  What I mean by that is: if you have had exposure to a course in system dynamics (not just classical dynamics), you should find that this book serves the purpose of teaching you control theory.  If on the other hand, you have not had exposure to system dynamics, you are in for a world of hurt, as the author does not guide the reader by the hand in developing the material in this book (note: this is particularly true in the early going when the material is presented as if it were a review, not a first go around).  In essence, you are left with a few choices: suffer through the text and repeatedly beat your head against the wall, get a solid system dynamics text to supplement the information in this book, or junk this text and find a control book that guides you through the subject matter a bit better - particularly if this is your first crack at control theory.  Option one isn't on the table if you really want a shot at passing your class, so for the other two options, consider the following: for a solid system dynamics text check out either Ogata, or Kelly (Ogata has alot of examples and MATLAB examples following the development of the subject matter, while Kelly has more meat in his development of the material and less examples however he does touch on developing Simulink models and some of his MATLAB codes are bit more sophisticated).  As far as an auxiliary control text, I would definitely check out Nise. His gentle development will allow the reader to easily grasp the subjects as presented and could be used as a self-study text on the subject matter (and both Nise and this text have nice a MATLAB brush-up as well as adaptation to the text material in their appendices and sprinkled through the text).  Overall not a bad text, but like a lot of the other reviewers I felt that it could be a bit better, so I'm knocking off a few stars.

There are good reasons why the subject of electric power engineering, after many years of neglect, is making a comeback in the undergraduate curriculum of many electrical engineering departments. The most obvious is the current public awareness of the ""energy crisis. "" More fundamental is the concern with social responsibility among college students in general and engineering students in particular. After all, electric power remains one of the cornerstones of our civilization, and the well-publicized problems of ecology, economy, safety, dependability and natural resources management pose ever-growing challenges to the best minds in the engineering community. Before an engineer can successfully involve himself in such problems, he must first be familiar with the main components of electric power systems. This text­ book will assist him in acquiring the necessary familiarity. The course for which this book is mainly intended can be taken by any student who has had some cir­ cuit analysis (using discrete elements, and including sinusoidal steady state) and elementary electromagnetic field theory. Most students taking the course will be in their junior or senior years. Once the course is completed, students may decide to go more deeply into the design and operation of these components and study them on a more advanced level, or they may direct their attention to the problems of the system itself, problems which are only hinted at briefly at various points herein.

Entrepreneurship in Power Semiconductor Devices, Power Electronics, and Electric Machines and Drive Systems introduces the basics of entrepreneurship and a methodology for the study of entrepreneurship in electrical engineering and other engineering fields. Entrepreneurship is considered here in three fields of electrical engineering, viz. power semiconductor devices, power electronics and electric machines and drive systems, and their current practice. It prepares the reader by providing a review of the subject matter in the three fields, their current status in research and development with analysis aspect as needed, thus allowing readers to gain self-sufficiency while reading the book. Each field’s emerging applications, current market and future market forecasts are introduced to understand the basis and need for emerging startups. Practical learning is introduced in: (i) power semiconductor devices entrepreneurship through the prism of 20 startups in detail, (ii) power electronics entrepreneurship through 28 startup companies arranged under various application fields and (iii) electric machines and drive systems entrepreneurship through 15 startups in electromagnetic and 1 in electrostatic machines and drive systems.  The book: (i) demystifies entrepreneurship in a practical way to equip engineers and students with entrepreneurship as an option for their professional growth, pursuit and success; (ii) provides engineering managers and corporate-level executives a detailed view of entrepreneurship activities in the considered three fields that may potentially impact their businesses, (iii) provides entrepreneurship education in an electrical engineering environment and with direct connection and correlation to their fields of study and (iv) endows a methodology that can be effectively employed not only in the three illustrated fields of electrical engineering but in other fields as well.  This book is for electrical engineering students and professionals. For use in undergraduate and graduate courses in electrical engineering, the book contains discussion questions, exercise problems, team and class projects, all from a practical point of view, to train students and assist professionals for future entrepreneurship endeavors.

Data and Electric Power: From Deterministic Machines to Probabilistic Systems in Traditional Engineering,Sean Patrick Murphy,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/a8/a9/f2/a8a9f2a68836095bad274529bca75152.jpg,"
                    Traditional engineering is built upon a world of knowledge and scientific laws, with components and systems that operate predictably. But what happens when a large number of these devices are interconnected? You get a complex system that’s no longer deterministic, but probabilistic. That’s happening today in many industries, including manufacturing, petroleum, transportation, and energy.

In this O’Reilly report, Sean Patrick Murphy, Chief Data Scientist at PingThings, describes how data science is helping electric utilities make sense of a stochastic world filled with increasing uncertainty—including fundamental changes to the energy market and random phenomena such as weather and solar activity.

Murphy also reviews several cutting-edge tools for storing and processing big data that he’s used in his work with electric utilities—tools that can help traditional engineers pursue a data-driven approach in many industries.

Topics in this report include:

    - Key drivers that have changed the electric grid from a deterministic machine into probabilistic system.
    - Fundamental differences that put traditional engineering and data science at odds with one another.
    - Why the time is right for engineering organizations to adopt a complete data-driven approach.
    - Contemporary tools that traditional engineers can use to store and process big data.
    - A PingThings case study for dealing with random geomagnetic disturbances to the energy grid.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/5213941/0f24d5,40,O’Reilly,2016,english,"PDF, 4.34 MB"
Power Quality in Power Systems and Electrical Machines,Ewald Fuchs,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/43/8c/e4/438ce4bde9f871cde37d5cfbfcbf454a.jpg,"
                    Power Quality of power systems affects all connected electrical and electronic equipment. Power Quality is a measure of deviations in voltage and frequency of the particular supply system. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in nonlinear loads; in particular distributed loads, such as computers, TV monitors and lighting. These draw harmonic currents which, when distorted, have detrimental effects including interference, loss of reliability, increased operating costs, equipment overheating, motor failures, capacitor failure and inaccurate power metering. This subject is pertinent to engineers involved with electric power systems, electronic equipment, computers and manufacturing equipment. This book shows readers to understand the causes and effects of power quality problems such as non-sinusoidal wave shapes, voltage outages, losses due to poor power quality, origins of single-time events such as voltage dips, voltage reductions, and outages, along with techniques to mitigate these problems.                                       .

                    This book equips the reader to understand every important aspect of the dynamics of rotating machines. Will the vibration be large? What influences machine stability? How can the vibration be reduced? Which sorts of rotor vibration are the worst? The book develops this understanding initially using extremely simple models for each phenomenon, in which (at most) four equations capture the behavior. More detailed models are then developed based on finite element analysis, to enable the accurate simulation of the relevant phenomena for real machines. Analysis software (in MATLAB) is associated with this book, and novices to rotordynamics can expect to make good predictions of critical speeds and rotating mode shapes within days.

                    The study of the kinematics and dynamics of machines lies at the very core of a mechanical engineering background. Although tremendous advances have been made in the computational and design tools now available, little has changed in the way the subject is presented, both in the classroom and in professional references.Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms brings the subject alive and current. The author's careful integration of Mathematica software gives readers a chance to perform symbolic analysis, to plot the results, and most importantly, to animate the motion. They get to ""play"" with the mechanism parameters and immediately see their effects. A CD-ROM packaged with the book contains Mathematica-based programs for suggested design projects.As useful as Mathematica is, however, a tool should not interfere with but enhance one's grasp of the concepts and the development of analytical skills. The author ensures this with his emphasis on the understanding and application of basic theoretical principles, unified approach to the analysis of planar mechanisms, and introduction to vibrations and rotordynamics.

This book is a result of the author's work which was initiated about a decade ago and which, in the meantime, has resulted in his Ph.D. Thesis and several technical papers. The book deals with accurate modeling of electric machines during transient and steady states, a topic which has been usually avoided in the literature. The modeling techniques herein take into account all machine peculiarities, such as the type and connection of its windings, slotting, and saturation in the iron core. A special emphasis in the book is given to the exact physical interpretation of all phenomena which influence the machine's transient behavior. Besides the Introduction, the book has five chapters. The second chapter describes basic concepts of the magnetic equivalent circuit theory and has examples of magnetic equivalent circuits of several types of machines with their node potential equations. In the third chapter the transform matrices w' and w"" of A.C. wind­ ings are derived. These matrices playa very important role in the magnetic equivalent circuit theory because they connect the quantities from the ma­ chine's magnetic equivalent circuit, branch fluxes, and mmfs with the ma­ chine's phase currents and fluxes.

Basic models and concepts of machine dynamics and motion control are presented in the order of the principal steps of machine design. The machine is treated as a coupled dynamical system, including drive, mechanisms and controller, to reveal its behavior at different regimes through the interaction of its units under dynamic and processing loads. The main dynamic effects in machines are explained. The influence of component compliances on accuracy, stability and efficiency of the machines is analyzed. Methods for decreasing internal and external vibration activity of machines are described. The dynamic features of digital control are considered. Special attention is given to machines with intense dynamic behavior: resonant and hand-held percussion ones. Targeted to engineers as well as to lecturers and advanced students.

Dynamic Thermal Analysis of Machines in Running State,Lihui Wang (auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/6f/34/ed/6f34ed69509629bd7db0495172df447c.jpg,"
With the increasing complexity and dynamism in today’s machine design and development, more precise, robust and practical approaches and systems are needed to support machine design. Existing design methods treat the targeted machine as stationery. Analysis and simulation are mostly performed at the component level. Although there are some computer-aided engineering tools capable of motion analysis and vibration simulation etc., the machine itself is in the dry-run state. For effective machine design, understanding its thermal behaviours is crucial in achieving the desired performance in real situation.Dynamic Thermal Analysis of Machines in Running State presents a set of innovative solutions to dynamic thermal analysis of machines when they are put under actual working conditions. The objective is to better understand the thermal behaviours of a machine in real situation while at the design stage. The book has two major sections, with the first section presenting a broad-based review of the key areas of research in dynamic thermal analysis and simulation, and the second section presents an in-depth treatment of relevant methodology and algorithms, leading to better understanding of a machine in real situation.The book is a collection of novel ideas, taking into account the need for presenting intellectual challenges while appealing to a broad readership, including academic researchers, practicing engineers and managers, and graduate students. Given the essential role of modern machines in factory automation and quality assurance, a book dedicated to the topic of dynamic thermal analysis, and its practical applications to machine design would be beneficial to readers of all design and manufacturing sectors, from machine design to automotive engineering, in better understanding the present challenges and solutions, as well as future research directions in this important area.

This book, intended for people in engineering and fundamental sciences, presents an integrated mathematical methodology for advanced dynamics and control of structures and machines, ranging from the derivation of models up to the control synthesis problem. This point of view is particularly useful as the physical insight and the associated structural properties, related e.g. to the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian framework, can be advantageously utilized. To this end, up to date results in disciplines like continuum mechanics, analytical mechanics, thermodynamics and electrodynamics are presented exploiting the differential geometric properties, with the basic notions of this coordinate-free approach revisited in an own chapter. In order to illustrate the proposed methodologies, several industrial applications, e.g., the derivation of exact solutions for the deformation compensation by shaped actuation in elastic bodies, or the coordination of rigid and flexible joint robots, are discussed.

Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms,Oleg Vinogradov,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/cb/da/d2/cbdad2d423676eb29a8366a356f9537e.jpg,"
                    The study of the kinematics and dynamics of machines lies at the very core of a mechanical engineering background. Although tremendous advances have been made in the computational and design tools now available, little has changed in the way the subject is presented, both in the classroom and in professional references.

Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms brings the subject alive and current. The author's careful integration of Mathematica software gives readers a chance to perform symbolic analysis, to plot the results, and most importantly, to animate the motion. They get to ""play"" with the mechanism parameters and immediately see their effects. A CD-ROM packaged with the book contains Mathematica-based programs for suggested design projects.

As useful as Mathematica is, however, a tool should not interfere with but enhance one's grasp of the concepts and the development of analytical skills. The author ensures this with his emphasis on the understanding and application of basic theoretical principles, unified approach to the analysis of planar mechanisms, and introduction to vibrations and rotordynamics.

Getting Started with CNC is the definitive introduction to working with affordable desktop and benchtop CNCs, written by the creator of the popular open hardware CNC, the Shapeoko. Accessible 3D printing introduced the masses to computer-controlled additive fabrication. But the flip side of that is subtractive fabrication: instead of adding material to create a shape like a 3D printer does, a CNC starts with a solid piece of material and takes away from it. Although inexpensive 3D printers can make great things with plastic, a CNC can carve highly durable pieces out of a block of aluminum, wood, and other materials. This book covers the fundamentals of designing for--and working with--affordable ($500-$3000) CNCs. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2755672/97998c,166,"Maker Media, Inc",2016,english,"PDF, 80.58 MB"

Computer Numerical Control (CNC) controllers, working as a brain for manufacturing automation, are high value-added products counting for over 30% of the price of machine tools. CNC technology is generally considered as a measure for the level of manufacturing technology of a nation. Often referred to as ""The Flower of Industrial Technology"", the development of CNC technology depends upon the integration of technologies from computer, hardware, machining, and other industries, and requires strategic long-term support, mostly on a governmental level.Theory and Design of CNC Systems covers the elements of control, the design of control systems, and modern open-architecture control systems. Topics covered include Numerical Control Kernel (NCK) design of CNC, Programmable Logic Control (PLC), and the Man-Machine Interface (MMI), as well as the major modules for the development of conversational programming methods. The concepts and primary elements of STEP-NC are also introduced.A collaboration of several authors with considerable experience in CNC development, education, and research, Theory and Design of CNC Systems is a highly focused textbook on the principles and development technologies of CNC controllers, which can also be used as a guide for those working on CNC development in industry.

                    The study of artificial intelligence and robotics offer the enormous potential of continuing the wide-reaching debate about how men and machines live together, now and in the future. The notion that a machine can respond to its environment, make decisions, and learn, has been the stuff of science fiction for hundreds of years. This work examines the key principles and concepts behind the engineering and technological advances that have allowed IBM’s Deep Blue to compete against professional chess players and game show contestants, and a device to by itself vacuum your house. Artificial intelligence (AI) infers that a machine can assess its surroundings and take steps toward a goal. Self-driving cars rely on AI not only to map a route and obey established traffic law, but also to respond to the behaviors of cars around them. Robots rely on computers, sensory feedback systems, and information processing in order to perform in the place of humans.

Machine vision inspection systems (MVIS) utilized all industrial and non-industrial applications where the execution of their utilities based on the acquisition and processing of images. MVIS can be applicable in industry, governmental, defense, aerospace, remote sensing, medical, and academic/education applications but constraints are different. MVIS entails acceptable accuracy, high reliability, high robustness, and low cost. Image processing is a well-defined transformation between human vision and image digitization, and their techniques are the foremost way to experiment in the MVIS. The digital image technique furnishes improved pictorial information by processing the image data through machine vision perception. Digital image pro­cessing has widely been used in MVIS applications and it can be employed to a wide diversity of problems particularly in Non-Destructive testing (NDT), presence/absence detection, defect/fault detection (weld, textile, tiles, wood, etc.,), automated vision test & measurement, pattern matching, optical character recognition & verification (OCR/OCV), barcode reading and traceability, medical diagnosis, weather forecasting, face recognition, defence and space research, etc. This edited book is designed to address various aspects of recent methodologies, concepts and research plan out to the readers for giving more depth insights for perusing research on machine vision using image processing techniques.

                    Vision plays a fundamental role for living beings by allowing them to interact with the environment in an effective and efficient way. The ultimate goal of Machine Vision is to endow artificial systems with adequate capabilities to cope with not a priori predetermined situations. To this end, we have to take into account the computing constraints of the hosting architectures and the specifications of the tasks to be accomplished, to continuously adapt and optimize the visual processing techniques. Nevertheless, by exploiting the low?cost computational power of off?the?shell computing devices, Machine Vision is not limited any more to industrial environments, where situations and tasks are simplified and very specific, but it is now pervasive to support system solutions of everyday life problems.

Introduction to Modeling and Simulation with MATLAB and Python is intended for students and professionals in science, social science, and engineering that wish to learn the principles of computer modeling, as well as basic programming skills. The book content focuses on meeting a set of basic modeling and simulation competencies that were developed as part of several National Science Foundation grants. Even though computer science students are much more expert programmers, they are not often given the opportunity to see how those skills are being applied to solve complex science and engineering problems and may also not be aware of the libraries used by scientists to create those models.   The book interleaves chapters on modeling concepts and related exercises with programming concepts and exercises. The authors start with an introduction to modeling and its importance to current practices in the sciences and engineering. They introduce each of the programming environments and the syntax used to represent variables and compute mathematical equations and functions. As students gain more programming expertise, the authors return to modeling concepts, providing starting code for a variety of exercises where students add additional code to solve the problem and provide an analysis of the outcomes. In this way, the book builds both modeling and programming expertise with a ""just-in-time"" approach so that by the end of the book, students can take on relatively simple modeling example on their own.  Each chapter is supplemented with references to additional reading, tutorials, and exercises that guide students to additional help and allows them to practice both their programming and analytical modeling skills. In addition, each of the programming related chapters is divided into two parts – one for MATLAB and one for Python. In these chapters, the authors also refer to additional online tutorials that students can use if they are having difficulty with any of the topics.  The book culminates with a set of final project exercise suggestions that incorporate both the modeling and programming skills provided in the rest of the volume. Those projects could be undertaken by individuals or small groups of students.   The companion website at http://www.intromodeling.com provides updates to instructions when there are substantial changes in software versions, as well as electronic copies of exercises and the related code. The website also offers a space where people can suggest additional projects they are willing to share as well as comments on the existing projects and exercises throughout the book.

                    Finite Element Modeling and Simulation with ANSYS Workbench combines finite element theory with real-world practice. Providing an introduction to finite element modeling and analysis for those with no prior experience, and written by authors with a combined experience of 30 years teaching the subject, this text presents FEM formulations integrated with relevant hands-on applications using ANSYS Workbench for finite element analysis (FEA).

                    A consensus on the fundamental status of theory of modeling and simulation is emerging – some recognize
the need for a theoretical foundation for M&S as a science. Such a foundation is necessary
to foster the development of M&S-specific methods and the use of such methods to solve real world
problems faced by practitioners. “[Theory of Modeling and Simulation (1976)] gives a theory for simulation
that is based on general system theory and this theory is considered the only major theory
for simulation. This book showed that simulation has a solid foundation and is not just some ad hoc
way of solving problems.” (Sargent, 2017). “Theory of Modeling and Simulation is a major reference
for modeling formalisms, particularly the Discrete Event Systems Specification (DEVS). ... We mention
the System Entity Structures and Model Base (SES/MB) framework as breakthrough in this field
[Model-base management]. It enables efficiency, reusability and interoperability.” (Durak et al., 2017).
For others there is the acknowledgment that certain of the theory’s basic distinctions such as the
separation, and inter-relation, of models and simulators, are at least alternatives to be considered in
addressing core M&S research challenges. Such challenges, and the opportunities to address them, are
identified in areas including conceptual modeling, computational methods and algorithms for simulation,
fidelity issues and uncertainty in M&S, and model reuse, composition, and adaptation (Fujimoto
et al., 2017).
With the assertion that “an established body of knowledge is one of the pillars of an established
discipline” (Durak et al., 2017), this third edition is dedicated to the inference that theory of M&S is an
essential component, and organizing structure, for such a body of knowledge. A prime emphasis of this
edition is on the central role of iterative specification of systems. The importance of iterative system
specification is that it provides a solid foundation for the computational approach to complex systems
manifested in modeling and simulation. While earlier editions introduced iterative specification as the
common form of specification for unifying continuous and discrete systems, this edition employs it
more fundamentally throughout the book. In addition to the new emphasis, throughout the book there
are updates to earlier material outlining significant enhancements from a broad research community. To
accommodate space for such additions some sections of the last edition have been omitted, not because
of obsolescence – indeed, new editions may re-instate these parts.
This Third Edition coordinates with a second book. “Model Engineering for Simulation” (MES) to
provide both a theoretical and application-oriented account of modeling and simulation. This makes
sense as a coordinated “package”, since most of the background theory material will be contained in
this book and the application to model engineering will be contained in MES. This partitioning into
theory and practice avoids unnecessary redundancy. The books will be published synchronously (or as
closely timed as practical). The editor/leaders of the two books have coordinated closely to assure that
a coherent whole emerges that is attractive to a large segment of the simulation community.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/3631856/445b65,674,Academic Press,2019,english,"PDF, 16.42 MB"

                    In Chemical Engineering Dynamics, the modelling of dynamic chemical engineering processes is presented in a highly understandable way using the unique combination of simplified fundamental theory and direct hands-on computer simulation. The mathematics is kept to a minimum, and yet the nearly 100 examples supplied on a CD-ROM illustrate almost every aspect of chemical engineering science. Each example is described in detail, including the model equations. They are written in the modern user-friendly simulation language Berkeley Madonna, which can be run on both Windows PC and Power-Macintosh computers.Madonna solves models comprising many ordinary differential equations using very simple programming, including arrays. It is so powerful that the model parameters may be defined as ""sliders"", which allow the effect of their change on the model behavior to be seen almost immediately. Data may be included for curve fitting, and sensitivity or multiple runs may be performed. The results can be seen simultaneously on multiple-graph windows or by using overlays. The resultant learning effect of this is tremendous.

Modeling and simulation in Python,Allen B. Downey,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/2a/f1/2f/2af12fba2a1e88e35701fa11462d796f.jpg,"
                    Modeling and Simulation in Python is an introduction to physical modeling using a computational approach.  It is organized in three parts:
• The first part presents discrete models, including a bikeshare system and world population growth.
• The second part introduces first-order systems, including models of infectious disease, thermal systems, and chemical kinetics.
• The third part is about second-order systems, including mechanical systems like projectiles, celestial mechanics, and rotating rigid bodies.
Taking a computational approach makes it possible to work with more realistic models than what you typically see in a first-year physics class, with the option to include features like friction and drag.
Python is an ideal programming language for this material.  It is a good first language for people who have not programmed before, and it provides high-level data structures that are well-suited to express solutions to the problems we are interested in.

FSR, the International Conference on Field and Service Robotics, is the leading single track conference of robotics for field and service applications. This book presents the results of FSR2012, the eighth conference of Field and Service Robotics, which was originally planned for 2011 with the venue of Matsushima in Tohoku region of Japan. However, on March 11, 2011, a magnitude M9.0 earthquake occurred off the Pacific coast of Tohoku, and a large-scale disaster was caused by the Tsunami which resulted, therefore the conference was postponed by one year to July, 2012. In fact, this earthquake raised issues concerning the contribution of field and service robotics technology to emergency scenarios. A number of precious lessons were learned from operation of robots in the resulting, very real and challenging, disaster environments. Up-to-date study on disaster response, relief and recovery was then featured in the conference. This book offers 43 papers on a broad range of topics including: Disaster Response, Service/Entertainment Robots, Inspection/Maintenance Robots, Mobile Robot Navigation, Agricultural Robots, Robots for Excavation, Planetary Exploration, Large Area Mapping, SLAM for Outdoor Robots, and Elemental Technology for Mobile Robots.
